I attempted to do the discarding of laser messages as early in the call stack of processing them as I could  while being able to access the trajectory builder options  where I think this option should be located. This turned out to be in the global trajectory builder class for the 2D case. I expect that you might have a better idea where this should go.    Also included are two completely miscellaneous things that I decided to add in the pull request so I don't have to keep them stashed the whole time. :)

This patch adds explicit search patches for the old and new environment.  Also  it searches for gmock.cc instead of CMakeLists.txt  as the later is too generic.

I face this issue recently when packaging cartographer in ROS. cartographer currently installs gtest and gmock library in the global library directory. This makes other packages fail as they will find these custom libraries rather than the system ones.  This problem happens only on "recent" operating systems (Debian Stretch and Ubuntu Artful and Bionic).  More details available on https://github.com/ros-gbp/cartographer-release/issues/8    I'm opening this PR for feedback mostly about the approach and will remove the commented code if the maintainers decide this is the right approach.    Nature of the change:  =================  - modify the macro `_common_compile_stuff` to respect the passed `VISIBILITY` argument  - modify the macro `google_test` to make the linkage of the gmock libraries private  - modify the main CMakeLists.txt to not add the GMock includes and libraries as part of the main target.    How to test the patch:   ===========  Requirement:  - a machine running one of the following OSs: Debian Stretch (9)  Ubuntu Artful (17.10) or Ubuntu Bionic (18.04)  - the packages `python-rosdep` and `ros-lunar-catkin` installed from the ROS repositories    To save time I use ROS docker images:  `docker run -it --rm osrf/ros:lunar-desktop-full-stretch`    1. Get the code with the patch  ```  mkdir -p /tmp/catkin_ws/src && cd /tmp/catkin_ws/src  git clone https://github.com/mikaelarguedas/cartographer -b dont_install_test_libs  ```  2. Edit package.xml to use the ceres rosdep key  ```  cd /tmp/catkin_ws/src/cartographer  sed -i 's/depend>ceres-solver</depend>libceres-dev</g' package.xml  cd /tmp/catkin_ws  ```  3. Get the dependencies  ```  rosdep update  rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src --rosdistro lunar -y  ```  4. Build cartographer  ```  source /opt/ros/lunar/setup.bash  catkin_make_isolated --install  ```  here libgtest* and libgmock* should NOT be listed in the installation step:  ```  ls install_isolated/lib/  libcartographer.a  ```    5. Run the tests:  ```  source install_isolated/setup.bash  catkin_make_isolated --install --make-args test  ```  All tests should run and pass.

You're setting `ABSL_BUILD_COMMAND`  but using `ABSEIL_BUILD_COMMAND` (effectively empty). Somehow this doesn't confuse newer CMakes  but the one you install on Trusty gets confused and interprets this as a no-op build step. This causes the indigo pipeline in cartographer_ros to fail.    Use the cross-platform build command instead:   https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/module/ExternalProject.html#obtaining-project-properties (just above the linked paragraph)

They are only visible in the directory they have been `add_library()`-ed in. This means that if we `find_package(Abseil)` from multiple places in a single project  the previously added `standalone_absl` target won't be seen  so we will enter the if in `FindAbseil.cmake` multiple times. However  `ExternalProject_Add` will crap out because it already added a project called `abseil` (which _is_ globally visible).    Solution: add [`GLOBAL`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.12/command/add_library.html#imported-libraries) to `add_library(standalone_absl IMPORTED)`.    While I was at it  I added `find_package(Abseil)` to `cartographer-config.cmake.in`  so libcartographer users don't have to do it  and did a small cleanup of quiet/required stuff. For `FindAbseil.cmake` to be visible from `cartographer-config.cmake`  I had to add the installed Cartographer cmake modules to CMAKE_MODULE_PATH.

I put the words port in quotes because the port doesn't require very much; it is mostly changes to compile on Ubuntu 20.04  plus some changes to the package.xml to make it a pure cmake package rather than a catkin one.    As-is  this PR doesn't apply to master.  That's because this "port" was originally done against the 1.0.0 tag of this repository. However  given the rather simple nature of this PR  it should be pretty easy to move forward.    I'm opening this PR as a starting point for the discussion on how to move this code into the upstream.  Some steps that seem obvious to me:    1.  Update this to apply against master.  1.  Create a ros2 branch for this to target    Some steps that are less obvious  and/or need discussion:  1.  Do we want to try to support ROS 1 and ROS 2 on the same branch?  It *might* be possible here  but I'm not sure.  1.  Is the cartographer project willing to take over maintenance of this branch and release it into newer ROS 2 versions as they come along?    Finally  I'll note that I don't have too much of time to devote to this.  I'm doing this on discretionary time  so while I'm glad to do some simple work here  I won't have the time to do any major refactoring.    Comments  questions  thoughts all welcome!

It enables a user to use an installed version of abseil. The main difference: If there is no installed package of Abseil  the repo will behave as before and download and build Abseil.  Thus  this PR should not mess with existing setups while allowing the user to use an installed version of Abseil.  I hope this prevents the concerns stopping  #1570 from getting merged.

Thus we can `add_subdirectory()` Abseil [just like the official documentation recommends](https://github.com/abseil/abseil-cpp/blob/master/CMake/README.md). CMake then knows about all Abseil targets and how they depend on each other since they're built in the same project  and we can link against them in a sane manner without having to enumerate all those static libraries in the right order. This also works much better with multi-configuration build systems such as MSVC since we properly propagate the build type.    The only downside is that this module was introduced very recently  in CMake 3.11. However  it's trivial to backport it to older CMake versions by just providing a copy  which I did in this PR.    @pifon2a

I put the words port in quotes because the port doesn't require very much; it is mostly changes to compile on Ubuntu 20.04  plus some changes to the package.xml to make it a pure cmake package rather than a catkin one.    As-is  this PR doesn't apply to master. That's because this "port" was originally done against the 1.0.0 tag of this repository. However  given the rather simple nature of this PR  it should be pretty easy to move forward.    I'm opening this PR as a starting point for the discussion on how to move this code into the upstream. Some steps that seem obvious to me:    * ~~Update this to apply against master.~~ This is now done.  * ~~Create a ros2 branch for this to target~~ We decided to try to merge this all into master.    Some steps that are less obvious  and/or need discussion:    * ~~Do we want to try to support ROS 1 and ROS 2 on the same branch? It might be possible here  but I'm not sure.~~  We decided we do.  * Is the cartographer project willing to take over maintenance of this branch and release it into newer ROS 2 versions as they come along?    Finally  I'll note that I don't have too much of time to devote to this. I'm doing this on discretionary time  so while I'm glad to do some simple work here  I won't have the time to do any major refactoring.    Comments  questions  thoughts all welcome!    This was originally PR #1701  but I had to close that one and move it to a new source branch.  Below are comments from that PR.    ---    @wohe said:    @clalancette I opened #1704 for the remaining focal related fixes. Some of the changes in this PR have already been fixed. I'll send a PR which adds focal to CI later.    Since this is the library without a dependency on ROS it should be possible to have one version for both ROS 1 and 2. The only ROS related file is the package.xml which to my understanding allows configuring dependencies differently based on the ROS version. Should we do this? Can you have a look? I dont't think anything would speak against merging a PR which just fixes up the package.xml for ROS 2 support.    ---    @clalancette said:      >    @clalancette I opened #1704 for the remaining focal related fixes.

I'm going to rebase this on top of master  and then see if I can get that working.
