What about newer gcc versions?  Do we even want to do that? It increases compile time and code size but - well  it will inline more obviously.

People were referred to U-Center.  therefore a gps_ubx_ucenter module was created that should replace GPS_CONFIGURE -auto-baudrate on startup  -read device version and adapt the settings (NAV/NAV2/NAV5) accordingly -possibility to get feedback in GCS (settings file/DEBUG message) -store too eeprom at the end for initial config of new modules -periodic instead of event (meaning if the GPS does not listen we can at least try again and not lock up)  Any comments  ideas  information  test results etc are very welcome...

But several questions remain: - how do we want to handle IMUs that don't have all sensors (e.g. not mag or accel at all  or only some gyros) - what about the temperature compensation we had in gyro.c for the roll gyro only?   - Do we want/need that?

This adds the possibility to register new timers with  `uint8_t sys_time_register_timer(uint32_t duration  sys_time_cb cb);` If a callback function is given  it will be directly called out of the sys_tick_irq_handler. If the callback function is NULL  the function `bool_t sys_time_check_and_ack_timer( uint8_t id )` can be used to check if the timer has elapsed. This also means that there is no `sys_time_periodic()` anymore  instead a timer is registered with the periodic frequency for that.  These "soft" timers are checked with every SysTick (every time the sys_time ISR gets called). This uses the SysTick feature of the stm32 and just calls the isr on a match of timer0 on the lpc21.  The sys tick frequency has to be set to at least the periodic frequency  and best be a multiple of it. Define `SYS_TIME_RESOLUTION` to set the timer resolution (1/periodic_freq obviously) in seconds. It currently defaults to 1/1024 and to 1/PERIODIC_FREQUENCY for fixedwing firmware.

and also adds Black Magic Probe support to the stm32 targets.  While merging aspirin2  I created a lisa_m_2_asp_2_pwm airframe file and added support for rotorcraft periodic frequencies to the aspirin2 driver.  The aspirin driver still misses support for magnetometer and pressure sensor readout using the i2c master support of the MPU-6000 found on aspirin 2 series.  This is a foundation block to start working on investigating the quat_cmpl filter issues as I currently only have the lisa/m 2 with asp 2 hardware available for R&D.  Please merge into the dev branch of the master repository.

Up until now the starting pulse width has been hardcoded to 1000us which in the case of the XAircraft multicopters results in the motors running at near full speed as soon as power is applied.  This change introduces a configurable value that will override the default (1000) if it is specified. To override the default define STOP_MOTOR with the starting pulse width value in the SUPERVISION section of the airframe.  Example:     &lt;section name="SUPERVISION" prefix="SUPERVISION_"&gt;     &lt;define name="STOP_MOTOR" value="100"/&gt;  Can't really decide on the best name for this (would INIT_MOTOR be better?).

Settings are now correctly converted to the unit specified in the airframe file when they are saved. BUT only if the _unit_ in the settings file is set correctly: needs to be the same as code_unit in the airframe file (for unit="deg" in airframe file  the code_unit defaults to "rad").  In the "Save Settings" dialog the values are now displayed in the alt_unit (same unit as slider).  The upload (button) of values is not clear to me. I'm not sure if this breaks the send_value when you press upload. I could not find where this is defined  or how it sends these values.... If we want to display the values in the slider alt_unit (so e.g. degrees instead of rad) we probably need to add another column for the value in the real units to use that to upload?

Oh  no then we stall when the propulsion has a problem... then we do pitch from airspeed. Oh no  then the plane will dive into the ground during takeoff. Then we will takeoff with throttle from airspeed  then switch to pitch from airspeed for flight and landing. But then we must make sure we do not climb to hard to keep the speed within limits. Let's limit the MAX_CLIMB to 1m/s. Hmmm... Why can't it just do what it is supposed to do: climb and descend fast  fly at the correct airspeed all the time  not stall on motor problems and not crash on takeoff without any mode change?  Well now you can:  Total Energy Control for paparazzi-fixedwing with imu.  -throttle controls the lack of energy  and pitch the balance (airspeed/height) -on total-energy saturation (e.g. engine failure or max climb) the energy balance lets loose of the altitude -on takeoff the plane will not dive if the acceleration requirement is met -you can climb with 100% and descend with 0% throttle -full-speed climb loop (e.g. 100Hz in imu_aspirin) instead of old 4Hz

This is not intended to be a finished piece of work  only intermediate. So consider this as something you could have a look into and possibly contribute  if you have more experience in SPI programming on the stm32 than me (and libopencm3). I'll continue to debug from here to see if I get things working.  Some feedback and insight is requested on point 1.  It does compile  but does not yet work.  Issues are:  1 phase  polarity selection not yet implemented <- probably requires some ideas on how to do that. It's a chicken/egg problem where mcu.c pre-initializes all SPI's  but where a module/peripheral may require a different configuration. This should then either lead to reinitialization of that bus or the make system should somehow allow flags/selectors for all SPI buses.  2 Only Aspirin2.1 was ported to use this new interface. Are there others?   I did not change plane configuration to check. I did notice that it isn't necessarily really difficult to port at that level.  3 The processor hangs at IMU configuration: static inline void mpu_wait_slave4_ready(void) {     ...     spi_submit(&spi2 &aspirin2_mpu60x0);      // FIXME: no busy waiting! if really needed add a timeout!!!!      while(aspirin2_mpu60x0.status != SPITransSuccess);    because the DMA1 ch.4 IRQ is never triggered. Could be SPI config problem or the config of irq's    or something related to timing.   4 A bit of further cleanup would be good. spi.h  which basically should act as a high-level interface now defines functions that appear in spi_arch.c within the architecture / processor branches.  5 I don't have a logic analyzer here  so can't see anything going on. Probably wouldn't be able to  since this board is soldered onto the bottom.  6 I've not verified the code that was there  except for proper use of pins and other defines. Afaik as I know  it's correct  but I'm not sure if more stuff is needed to configure for example the NVIC.  7 I'm not an embedded driver developer  this is my first try at this. So if you see something strange  it's probably not supposed to be that way. The code is certainly not there because of my ninja skills :).

It is now possible to reconfigure the SPI bus per transaction  thus also when any device starts using the bus (overriding the defaults). When the config doesn't change  the bus is not reconfigured.  The suspend/resume functionality is also added (spi_lock/spi_resume).  Some further improvements and bug fixes made.  This has now only been testing using aspirin2 on SPI2 and a new W5100 ethernet chip implementation on SPI1 (the external SPI).   The "rx" parameter was removed from the callback function prototype. I noticed in the end that the callback is only called when the transaction is finished. For tx+rx type transactions  this is when the rx is finished. for tx only  when tx ends. For rx only  when rx ends. The callback passes the transaction that has finished executing.  This should wrap up the work on the SPI improvements  pending a lot more testing by other people of course.  Please review.

It also reads command packets. Hooking this up to the ground station requires one to run 2 UDP scripts  which proxy the data from the ethernet connection to the paparazzi UDP ports that are open  reusing earlier work done on UDP links through an overo I think?   See below for possible configuration details.  It is recommended to use the WIZ811MJ breakout board of sparkfun  as others have issues with the SPI_EN gate not connected through an inverter  leaving the chip activate during other comms on the same IP bus (if this appies).  Connect the chip on the external SPI1. You can configure the multicast ip  port and (fixed) ip in the airframe file:  ``` <subsystem name="telemetry" type="w5100">   <configure name="W5100_IP" value="192 168 2 2"/>   <configure name="W5100_SUBNET" value="255 255 255 0"/>   <configure name="W5100_MULTICAST_IP" value="1 1 1 1"/>   <configure name="W5100_MULTICAST_PORT" value="5432"/> </subsystem> ```  The ground segment includes two additional python scripts  which work as proxies on the local machine. I've attempted to work with the caml script  but that isn't my thing and this seemed the easiest thing to do.  I had to pull in one commit regarding the definition of some v_ctl_\* parameters to get my airframe to compile.  I'm still looking for a solution on the while loop in the get/set functions. The chip unfortunately cannot send multiple bytes in one transaction  so one byte of telemetry actually costs 4 bytes on the SPI bus  plus more to query read/write pointers and perform the actual sending.   Throughput on SPI is about 0.3Mb/s maximum. I did not change the telemetry file  but it should be possible to increase the frequency of certain messages there. I don't feel the need to do that however and it may slow down other loops.

The strange thing is that this does not occur if I disable the magnetometers and read gyros and accels only. What I did to fix the issue is to call adxl345_clear_rx_buf() at the beginning of adxl_start_reading_data().

The ap.elf runs on the AR.Drone2  but not much is happening yet. I think the next step is to program the communication between Airborne paparazzi and GCS! Happy coding :dancer:   ~Dino

The consequence is that the reference model goes faster then specified in the airframe file and the difference in the rates that is used for the feedback is wrong.

I have included a considerable explanation for the flightplan as well on how to use it. I would really appreciate some feedback on it  what should be changed  what is totally wrong  how to make it more understandable  etc. I haven't fully tried it out on a real aircraft yet due to some datalink issues  only in simulation with JSBSim. The explanation will be added to the wiki after comments/discussion.  While tuning for a funjet or similar is relatively easy because of existing gains that are close to what they should be  I think that a better process can be useful  especially for dissimilar aircraft. We are tuning a Senior Telemaster at the moment  and it has had some interesting and unstable behaviour using "default" gains gleaned from a number of airframe example files.  Even though I don't want it pulled yet so I can edit it based on comments  I thought this (github) would be a good way for others to look at it and make comments.  As I have never actually fully tuned a pprz aircraft before  insight from others would be nice!  Thanks.

In my setup I copied channel 1 to channel 6 as a workaround. If the ppm pulse_type issue is fixed  this update can be merged as well so that one more channel becomes available.

sys_time_init calling sys_time_arch_init which enables the timer used in sys_time_usleep which uses T0TC = system register  So it should be running as soon as the timer is enabled in sys_time_arch_init.  however  the sys_time_usleep only seems to work after a irqEnable() which is weird.  [in AVR  starting the timer will make the timer run  so reading the timer value T0TC will change all the time  even with no interrupts. ClearInterruptEnable only means that no ISR will be called  not that hard timers will not run.]  Just read the datasheet and there is no reason why T0TC should not run after being enabled  and I can find no reason why enableIRQ (which sets Current Program Status Register IRQ bit) would influence how the timer is running.  Anyone that can explain is welcome.  In the mean time  call xbee_init AFTER mcu_int_enable  just like in fixedwing.

Tested with gcc-arm-embedded (https://launchpad.net/gcc-arm-embedded) 4_7-2012q4 on mac os x. Also with the mac os x paparazzi toolchain. On the airframes/esden/quady_lm2a2pwm.xml airframe file.  The toolchain is more optimized for arm cortex m and r series cpus. We may want to actually switch to that toolchain for stm32 controllers  as it has official backing by the ARM consortium and they seem to know what they are doing. :)  This patch should also make possible to compile using stock summon arm toolchain too. (not tested)

A brand new xbee out of the box (stock setting=9k6) will now work right away without any external config even with 57k6bps firmware.  PS: autoconfig for now does not work if your ground modem sends data to the aircraft...

In all quadrants the course now appears correct  although the skytraq chip with default firmware seems to lag a bit in the course updates  but that's due to internal filtering and calculations.

interrupt handler occasionally hang in case of noise on the line.  Fixes were two: 1) Disable IDLE line interrupt  disable LIN break interrupt (neither of them should be used for asynchronous single buffer communication) in the port settings. 2) In interrupt handler routine  explicitly check for the error flags  only if no errors occur  check the received byte. Otherwise clear the USART_DR and log the error.  Error logging variables are added to monitor errors on the port.

It works  but can still be improved by improving the formula for transforming 10bit adc value for voltage range of 0-1.5V to the ardrone battery voltage. I dont know how the battery is electrically connected so I'm not sure on how to properly improve this yet. One idea is to measure a few fully charged battery and a few depleted ones and write down the max and min voltage. then with the same batteries measure the 10bit adc value and solve a function for it.   For now this can be used  but I cant officially say much about the accuracy.  Regards   Dino

The module would have listening threads for each submodule  if event is triggered  data are saved - something like this:  ``` __attribute__((noreturn)) msg_t thd_dummy(void *arg) {   chRegSetThreadName("module_logger");   (void) arg;    EventListener elGpsData;   chEvtRegister(&eventGpsData  &elGpsData  EVT_GPS_DATA);    while (TRUE)   {     chEvtWaitAny(EVENT_MASK(EVT_GPS_DATA));     send_gps_data();   } } ```  **Advantages** - no need to have logger specific code  all is handled in the module and the event sources have minimal footprint  so they can stay on all the time  **Disadvantages** - the logger would have to have a listening thread for each event source (e.g. gps  radio  electrical...)  which is not very economical  but with lisa-mx it is not a big deal to have 3 extra threads (256bytes each)

The hope is that it makes it more readable and also easier to add new STM familiies...  Possible drawback with current libopencm3 version is however that these API functions are real functions (not static inline) and hence might incur some overhead.

ardrone2 development back into master. First I'm going to explain some background information so it's clear what the context is and what has been done so far.  We began with two groups each working on getting paparazzi on an ardrone. The difference is that one group went with the pure/raw approach. That means writing drivers for actuators  sensors and other hardware. The second team went with the SDK/API approach. On the ardrone2 runs a software program which provides an API trough AT-Commands which can be used to communicate what you want the ardrone to do. So the second team does not directly control the ardrone  but tells the middleware software what to do.  Now there two branches were called minor1 (raw) and minor2 (sdk). Later on I branched of minor1 my own branch called dhensen. Last week I've merged dhensen + minor2 into ardrone_to_master with some help from C. de Wagter.  With the sdk version we can allready fly autonomously with an u-blox gps receiver. With the api version we need some more tuning and maybe ultrasound + barometer.  Now we want to merge it back into master as soon as possible  because a lot of acadamic work is depending on it.  TODO for SDK version: -cameras (from sdk/api  should be relatively simple) -gains tuning  TODO for RAW version: -solve magnetometer problems -read out battery (i2c?) -ultrasound integration/implementation -baro calculations -cameras (reverse engineered) -gains tuning  TODO for both versions: -gps module integration  I'll be waiting for the pull request to be accepted! In the mean time feedback is very much welcome and will be handled with care.  -Dino

Navdata was corrupted on 2.4.8 but this problem was identified and is solved in this pull request. Now 2.4.8 is probably recommended but v2.4.3 is still good (but probably has some unresolved firmware bugs).  parrot v2.4.8 firmware now has a respawner service. After killing program.elf  it restarted automatically. Now 2 programs were reading the serial data. Byte loss  package loss etc....  On top of that apparently program.elf has a routine that seems to try to recalibrate the navboard frequency (navboard has no crystal but runs on internal oscillator like many price-aware products) probably when many CRC errors occur. Since ap.elf is also reading data  program.elf also only gets half the data (=lot of CRC errors). On the logic analyser one can see a process (program.elf) sending codes to the navboard which then stops sending navdata and then restarts sending data 1 packet later at a slightly different baudrate (accorinding to the logic analyser autobaud).  Killing not only program.elf but also its respawner magicaly solves the navdata problem (and probably also the video problem [to be confirmed])

If tested and everything is ok  this fixes #156  #158 and #166

The throttle preset has to be v_ctl_auto_cruise_setpoint (set by the user via gcs)  not v_ctl_throttle_setpoint (set by vertical guidance loop)  otherwise pitch_trim is affected by vertical control. Pitch is already set in vertical control  so there is no need to correct it with loiter function.    Rate limiter also added to pitch_trim. - Reference generator update: - added possibility to configure reference generator in airframe file.  The damping and cut-off frequency can be different for roll and pitch. Telemetry message "H_CTL_A" updated with setpoint  reference  estimated angle and control surface order.

All sensors on the board are supported and they currently give data to paparazzi. The only thing missing is to calibrate and  determine the correct orientation of the sensors with respect to the board.  To compile this it is necessary to apply the changes that I'm sending in another pull-request to libopencm3. Also  be sure to use the proper libopencm3 submodule.  Also  luftboot may complain about an error. It will get fixed with the following patch:  diff --git a/src/luftboot.c b/src/luftboot.c index d83cd52..730c420 100644 --- a/src/luftboot.c +++ b/src/luftboot.c @@ -483 7 +483 7 @@ int main(void)  ```     gpio_init(); ``` -       systick_set_clocksource(STK_CTRL_CLKSOURCE_AHB_DIV8); -       systick_set_clocksource(STK_CSR_CLKSOURCE_AHB_DIV8);       systick_set_reload(900000);       systick_interrupt_enable();       systick_counter_enable();  This is because of the current libopencm3 trunk state.

I tested it in my transition branch  there it works very well. At thrust settings where I would normally get 30 degrees deviation from the magnetic north  this is now only 3 degrees.  The calibration is done by slowly ramping up the motors with the uav held steady on the ground. It is done best without the control laws to avoid feedback on the heading which will then influence the magnetometer reading again.  Theoretically a better implementation would be to calibrate for each motor individually  but that would require separate calibration code to spin each motor up. This could be a next step.  I also flight tested with the correction in place and this resulted in a much better autonomous flight.

So any subsystem/module that needs to know any of these states should not get it directly from the ahrs  gps  airspeed sensors or whatever and just read it from the state interface. It will also do the appropriate coordinate and fixed/floating point conversions automatically and only when needed. This should decouple e.g. estimation and control more and also the "consumers" of vehicle states don't need to worry about where the data is actually coming from and in what format it was estimated or measured.  Current status: - Most of the state interface and needed conversions are done - You can set e.g. the position in any coordinate system you wish: `stateSetPositionNed_i(pos_ned_i)` to set the position in fixed-point NED coordinates - If you need to read the position somewhere else in a different representation  simply call: `stateGetPositionLla_f()` and only then the LLA float position representation is calculated and returned on the fly. It's also only calculated once  until a new position is set.  There are however some open questions that need addressing before we go further: -  How to deal with the problem that a given representation can't be calculated or is not valid  e.g.   - something needed for conversion not initialized (e.g. LTP origin not initialized)   - simply no measurement of the state available (e.g. no airspeed sensor)   - state not valid (e.g. no 3d GPS fix  hence pos/speed not valid) - Add extra functions to set multiple representations of the same state at once  or allow to set a state without marking the other representations as uncalculated?   - E.g. when the GPS already does the work and calculates several representations  why not use that instead of only setting one and doing the conversions again ourselves...

We are using pull request so it is easier to comment the code and discuss about it.</b>  Dear developers  dear community. Here is the first version of Real Time Paparazzi  based on ChibiOS/RT(http://www.chibios.org) and extending work of @enacuavlab. It is certainly not a complete work  rather the first step how to adapt Paparazzi to a RT OS. The system is developed and tested on Lia 1.1 (STM32F1  http://paparazzi.enac.fr/wiki/Lisa/M_v2.0) board  so it can be easily used in existing autopilots.  The system architecture is shown below. To change as little code as possible  Paparazzi interfaces with ChibiOS via new main_chibios.c file (main thread  invoking other threads according to the system settings) and via arch/chibios files. Those are basically middleware  translating between high-level architecture independent paparazzi functions (such as uart_transmit) and ChibiOS HAL API (such as sdWrite).   To get the full potential of RT system  the monolithic Paparazzi application had to be split into more individual threads. Threads are effectively replacing periodic function and events. That is probably the biggest change. The rewards are control over task timing and priorities  and hardware independence for Paparazzi. The ChibiOS drivers are also expected to be more efficient  since DMA is natively used where applicable (USART  SPI).  ![rt_paparazzi](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/2790461/1304555/48400060-3183-11e3-979b-6731eb2ba4d8.png)  <b>Benefits of ChibiOS/RT&Paparazzi:<b/> - HAL for interaction with HW (libopencm3 not needed  deployable on any architecture that ChibiOS supports - see http://www.chibios.org/dokuwiki/doku.php?id=chibios:architectures) - Real time system (precise control over task timing and priorities via independent threads) - Error handling (defined error handlers  timeouts for tasks/threads)  fixes for example #531   <b>Features of version 0.1:<b/> - Paparazzi & ChibiOS compiles and run from Paparazzi center - Upload over JTAG or DFU (bootloader) - Rotorcraft firmware with ap target (hexarotor_lia_rt.xml) - Telemetry and GPS works (as an example of I/O handling - ublox and PprzTransport) - Heartbeat and basic OS info available - Example of arch/chibios code (uart_arch.*)  For illustration  the current system set-up is shown below: ![rtos_telemetry_ii](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/2790461/1304779/fdbb111e-3188-11e3-990d-1cafb2a5e526.png)  <b>Note:</b> - GCC ARM Embedded toolchain was used for compilation https://launchpad.net/gcc-arm-embedded  <b>Pending:</b> - Finish arch/chibios middleware for all peripherals (SPI  I2C  PWM  PPM) - Add threads for subsystems (imu data  ahrs  actuators) and modules - Figure out the best way how to interface the current events/periodic functions with threads - Mutex for all structs that can be accessed simultaneously (e.g gps  ahrs  ins...) - Define timers and error handlers for peripherals (i2C etc) - set ChibiOS as a separate github module (so it can be updated by ChibiOS developers)  We would gladly appreciate any feedback on our work  especially code style/attribution  architecture design  interface between Paparazzi and ChibiOS etc. so the RT Paparazzi can fly soon!

If outuput and input length are not the same  dummy dma transfers are used to for the remaining ones. This ensures that if output_len < input_len the SCK is generated and zeros are sent for the remaining words. Input dma is also run for full transaction length even if input < output. The rx dma transfer complete interrupt is used to signal the end of the transaction Zero input/output length cases are handled by immediately using a dummy dma transfer.  Also some more refactoring and cleanup...  This closes #337 and #348.

Use any aiframe (default quadrotor_lisa_m_2_pwm_spektrum.xml Initialize I2C bus and start sending messages (for example set LISA_M_BARO to BARO_MS5611_I2C to use i2c2)  the peripheral actually doesnt have to be there to reproduce the bug. The AP will run  if there is no device with a matching address on the line  it will just accumulate ack_errors. Take an oscilloscope probe and touch i2c2 SDA line. The system freezes  only timer interrupts will continue (SYS_LED is blinking  PWM output still works  so for example motor keeps running but radio stops responding). Why?  Somehow the i2c interrupt routine doesn't clear the flags properly  so the system will forever hangs in the i2c_ev_isr() or i2c_error() -verified with JTAG Timers will continue to run  because they are higher priority isrs than i2c.  Another way to reproduce the bug is to short the SDA/SCL line (instant)  start sending more messages on the i2c line to more than one device (takes around a minute  but depends on the message rate)  or just let the system run and it might freeze by itself (seemingly randomly).  Indeed VERY dangerous behaviour  since the motors will be still running  but there will be no control over the system.  The right driver should handle all possible error conditions on the line and recover from them.  This is just a quick fix  which won't let the system freeze (so it is safe)  but the i2c communication doesn't always recover after the error (such as shorting the leads)  so you might lost for example pressure readings during flight...  Suggestions to improve are welcome.

no longer in the ubuntu repository  so when paparazzi center promts with the "changes were made" screen and you click the View Changes  nothing happens because most users who use a new version of ubuntu don't have ubuntu. They also don't know what the problem is because no feedback is given unless you run ./paparazzi from the commandline (people will usually create an icon to click).   I propose meld  its clean.  Maybe this should even be a user setting.

Instead of making decisions about how to configuration the ublox input/output port based on the GPS_PORT_ID  this code makes configuration decisions based on the response that it receives from the ublox when it queries the port type.  Added lots of comments and #defines to explain numbers used in configuration. Added the ability to change the ublox dynamic model (portable  automotive  airborne  etc) via the aircraft configuration file.  I have tested this only with UART and have not tested with DDC (I2C)  USB  or SPI. Looking at the description and comments in gps_i2c.xml  it appears that the I2C gps module was/is "currently broken".  Fixes #647

This allows for better handling of them in different controllers.  New and properly working transformations from earth commands to quaternions added. No proper fixedpoint implementation so far... no change there compared to current master though. Should still be done for efficiency.  Tested the int_quat stablizitation with this in simulation and it works perfectly as expected.  **IMPORTANT**: This does currently not have the feature to "add" roll/pitch setpoints via RC in nav/hover anymore. Is that really used  instead of switching to manual if needed? Instead you can give velocity commands in hover mode via RC.  Includes max bank improvements proposed in #546 - Split PD and I-gain with separate max bank   - no wind: integrator (trim attitude) = 0  PD maxbank = -20 to 20 extra: total: -20 to 20   - huge wind: integrator (trim attitude) = 20  PD maxbank = -20 to 20 extra: total: 0 to 40 - Put gain before integrator to get better insight in the saturation values - Reduce integration overshoots while increasing integration speed by adding the speed error as well   - no speed error: integrate as before   - counterproductive speed error  integrate faster   - if the position error is already decreasing fast  no integrator is needed or it will overshoot

I think this would be a good idea:  All control gains are defined with a positive sign  in the airframe file  in the settings  etc At initialization of the control gain variables  the absolute value of the define in the airframe file is taken. This ensures that people with old airframe files don't suddenly see the opposite behaviour. It will just continue to work. If no-one can come up with any drawbacks  I will merge it soon-ish.

It outputs voltage  current and mAh consumed. For every i2c request on the bus  it reads only 10 bytes. Every sensor has a slightly different configuration on current gain etc.  so some calibration may be required (see immersionrc product page). Most important here are accurate readings for voltage  but current and mAh consumed can become useful in the future for mWh calculations and knowing when to go for home. This sensor is also useful as a regulator for a +5V power supply directly off the battery (with reasonable current consumption) and there is another terminal at +VBATT that can be spliced up for other equipments like 12V tx's and such.  I've got the GND  DAT  CLK connected during testing  but _only_ connect +5V when USB is not connected on the LIsa for obvious reasons.   In this commit I also disabled the regular "electrical" module  which assumes voltage and current measurement on analog pins  as these would otherwise regularly overwrite the ezosd measurements. There may be better ways to do this  as now it probably depends on compiler optimization for the code not to be included.  The ezcurrent module is implemented as a standard sensor module in xml  so it can be 'loaded' as a module in the airframe. What may be necessary is a standard define on the port it's expected:  <define name="USE_I2C1"/>  Testing: - voltage output correct. - current not fully tested in this implementation  but observed correct in other implementations of the same module on arduino.  - consumption not fully tested in this implementation  but observed correct in other implementations of the same module on arduino.   Unsure: - Whether the sensor SCL/SDA are 5v/3.3v. the lisa pins are definitely 5V tolerant though  but not sure if the other side was built for either 5v or 3.3v.

Currently  with the -speech option on the gcs  it reads out the aircraft name prior to the alert. This takes considerable time when an aircraft name is something like UAV_3_Config_B  and reduces the effectiveness of audible alerts. As such  one can now specify a speech_name in the conf.xml entry for the aircraft  which the speech function will use as an alternative. Only letters  numbers and underscores are valid (not checked in code  currently exits GCS  needs better error handling  maybe checked as ac_name in pc_aircraft.ml). To skip the name altogether  simply use a single underscore. If no speech_name is given  the default is to use the aircraft name  as before. The speech name is what shows up in the alerts tab in the GCS. Note that this was tested on OS X Lion in simulation only  no real tests or replay tests have yet been completed.  It is not yet completed  because paparazzi center does not handle the new field in the xml yet  and it gets deleted as soon as you make a change (like switching a/c in the dropdown). Also need add an example.  Add to the conf.xml like so: <aircraft    name="Microjet"    ac_id="5"    ...    gui_color="#6293ba"    speech_name="My_Plane"   />  @gautierhattenberger any thoughts on how to fix the paparazzi center side? I want it to be able to handle either having the xml field  or not  and not having to have the field there.  Any thoughts on this and feedback/criticism would be appreciated.

Assuming for now that you don't use the horizontal reference (GUIDANCE_H_USE_REF not defined and hence the ref is zero) and you are within HOLD_DISTANCE  I would expect the same behavior from nav (with "stay"on a waypoint) as with AP_MODE_HOVER_x  **This should fix that  but will change the behavior in AP_MODE_HOVER** This means that if you tuned the p-gain and i-gain in AP_MODE_HOVER_x before  you will have to divide the old p-gain by 2 and the old i-gain by 4.

Please let me know if other changes needed.  The two module system compiles on microjet_example.xml  but hasn't been tested yet. The original single module method was tested on a TWOG with the radio modem on the ground  not in flight. No changes to the mcu_periph things since the test.  PWM input currently only works on lpc21xx arch  with input channels setup focusing on TWOG/Tiny 2. arch  but relatively easy to add more cases.  pwm_input got moved to a mcu_periph for hw access  got rid of some available channels that seem to conflict with generally in use resources (except perhaps in other arch use cases  like csc or motor bench testing).  pwm_meas is just a wrapper module that initializes the hw so other modules do not initialize the same pwm_input twice  xtend_rssi module reads in the pwm duty cycle from a Digi 9Xtend radio modem and sends a message with the duty %  rssi dB above fade margin and the datalink time  useful in checking range. Depends on the pwm_meas module to initialize.  See also #86

If USE_BAROMETER alt_kalman is always enabled and if you don't want to use altitude/climb_rate filtering  use the ins type "gps_passthrough". Now if you use the alt_float INS  it's always enabled (which is what most people expect anyway).  In theory it was possible to disable the alt_kalman in flight before (if ! USE_BAROMETER)  but I very much doubt that was used since there also was no settings file for it.

Well now you can:   Total Energy Control for paparazzi-fixedwing with imu.  -throttle controls the lack of energy  and pitch the balance (airspeed/height) -on total-energy saturation (e.g. engine failure or max climb) the energy balance lets loose of the altitude -on takeoff the plane will not dive if the acceleration requirement is met -you can climb with 100% and descend with 0% throttle -full-speed climb loop (e.g. 100Hz in imu_aspirin) instead of old 4Hz  Test pilots are being searched.

This ensures that people with old airframe files don't suddenly see the opposite behaviour. It will just continue to work.      If no-one can come up with any drawbacks  I will merge it soon-ish.

While merging aspirin2  I created a lisa_m_2_asp_2_pwm airframe file and added support for rotorcraft periodic frequencies to the aspirin2 driver.  The aspirin driver still misses support for magnetometer and pressure sensor readout using the i2c master support of the MPU-6000 found on aspirin 2 series.  This is a foundation block to start working on investigating the quat_cmpl filter issues as I currently only have the lisa/m 2 with asp 2 hardware available for R&D.

Fix the poly_survey_adv waiting in Entry mode  The poly_survey_adv function was waiting for the plain height to be close to the waypoint's altitude.  The PhotogrammetryCalculatorPolygonSurvey function was not calculating well the angles.  There might be a confusion between rad and degree. That fixe doesn't correct that  but with it the function works.  The call to init_poly_survey_adv in PhotogrammetryCalculatorPolygonSurveyADV needs a angle in degree.  The init_poly_survey_adv might be asking for an angle in rad  be it uses it later as an angle in degree. So we send it in degree.

You can now run `vagrant ssh` to log in to the development environment. The `~/paparazzi` directory in the VM is actually the `paparazzi` directory in your host operating system -- changes in either directory show up in the other.  ``` $ vagrant ssh # cd paparazzi # make # ./paparazzi ```  Beware that this will sync the complete paparazzi directory on your host system with the ~/paparazzi dir on the VM!

One possibility is to use 250ms for a single pulse  750ms for shutting the camera off.  this script has been tested on an IXUS 220 HS and is working by clicking the buttons on the gcs console. Camera shuts down and pictures are taken correctly.  I'm still working out some final details on the chdk script  but don't see a good location to put the file in the paparazzi repository. I was expecting something like a scripts or external directory for that.   Also note that the exact timing for actuating the shutter is off by 250ms (one quartersec)  at least for the led_cam_ctrl. The DC module is actuated at the end of the 4hz function in the led_cam_ctrl.c file. The shutter LED is turned on/off already. So in total it takes 2 4Hz passes to shut down the LED again  which is 500ms. For me  I'm just setting the shutter_delay to 0  because I don't fully know the effects of bringing this DC function call at the top of the function.

Especially for the ins xsens subsystem. - removed the AhrsEvent - removed all imu and ahrs things from ins_xsens - added an InsEvent for fixedwings - removed some gps stuff from ins_xsens and used the normal gps callbacks instead - made baud rate for xsens configurable  Please take a look and test if that works as I don't have a xsens to test.... Also feel free to clean this up further...  I should (tm) work...

Previously the values of the IGAIN should have been in a very high range. I'm not sure if this is the correct range now  so maybe someone can look into that a little bit more? - Introduced a VGAIN (feedforward speed)  to compensate drag.  AHRS: - Made it possible to define the course deviation. This is needed for the indoor GPS  because with fast turns the course can deviate more than the maximum.   This isn't the nicest way to implement the heading of the tracking system  but it works as supposed with minimum changes.  INS: - Added the possibility to use the GPS altitude in the kalman filter. This is also needed for the indoor GPS  but could also be used outdoor if you trust the GPS altitude.  Next tot that I added all these functions to the ardrone2 (indoor) airframe and tuned some of these gains.

It can be completely disabled by not loading the module. I included an example of how to specify multiple gain sets in airframes/esden/gain_scheduling_example.xml. I made it configurable  so the user can specify on which variable to schedule and any number of gain sets is supported.  The module runs at 20 Hz  which should be high enough for all applications.   With this module enabled  in air tuning is not possible any more  because the module will immediately overwrite the set gains. This should be changed in the future so that you edit the gains in the gainlibrary instead of the the active gains.

Overview: - persistent_settings.xml is a file that adds a persistence tab to the gcs so the store function can be triggered. - settings.c added a check that the store function cannot be triggered in flight. The regular parameter updates however will still continue to work  so one can update the parameters as usual  they just won't be saved until the user lands the aircraft and then clicks store.  - the airframe shows how persistent storage functions are actually added to the code. Without the USE_PERSISTENT_SETTINGS define  the storage functions won't be added to the compilation stage. - a minor update to the radio file  which uses always 8 channels and not 7. - added the jsbsim xml file for the simulator. - added a script to start flightgear with a mikrokopter.  Without any "persistent=true" attributes in any settings file  the persistent storage structure remains empty and the result of writing will be 0 (also in the UI). So  the next question is which parameters in the config files will need to be made persistent. Instead of going ahead and proposing the changes in a couple of changed files  I will open this topic on the mailing list on how to approach this subject.  Testing: - I added persistent=true to one file temporarily  recompiled and reloaded the code. Then I verified the function gets called and the flash memory is updated. - I then stopped all processes  reflashed and rebooted the boards and restarted all processes. - Then I went into the GCS  noticed the default value A for the specific parameter  modified that to value B  clicked the tick mark to upload this value  then clicked the Store function  remembering the value B.  - I verified the "store" button changed from 0. to "Store" (which means the store was successful). - Then I killed all processes  removed power from the boards and restarted everything. - I waited for the server process to accumulate the new settings (these get sent by telemetry in an iterative process).  - Then I went into settings and verified the value of that specific parameter  which appeared as value B.

MODE_STARTUP is set to AP_MODE_NAV for the autonomous (without RC) ARDrone2. Without AUTOPILOT_DISABLE_AHRS_KILL it will force MODE_STARTUP until the ahrs is aligned  but still not allow to turn on the motors (as that also checks for ahrs_is_aligned).

That is already done now for rotorcraft firmware  for fixedwings it is still using the defined freq. The fixedwing ins_alt_float now uses the real dt for alt_kalman update from baro or gps. Should be cleaner like this and less prone to misconfiguration  possible drawback however is that you get some more jitter on the DT.  Not really properly taken into account for: - int_cmpl_euler: this is very ugly and still has F_UPDATE 512Hz hardcoded  but nobody should use this one anyway.. - float_cmpl and int_cmpl_quat: still use AHRS_PROPAGATE_FREQUENCY to set the gains...  Also should we put bounds on the dt that is calculated from sys_time (e.g. in the baro and gps update of ins_alt_float)?

Also made it possible to not use the reference model in the control  as it is not working out for me. I find it to be very sensitive and not robust if you really want to make the feedforward work.   I changed the way the current yaw is determined to avoid switching beyond 90 degrees  as this would be unwanted when transitioning (and for quads as well). The other option I considered was changing the BODY_TO_IMU rotation  but I found this to be less clear  for instance when reviewing the logs.  Any comments are welcome!

Upon an error it would first go up to ~32000 and then if the error persisted go down again. This is obviously unwanted. I changed to a regular sum of each of the error values.  For the ground detection  the autopilot_ground_detected was reset before the nav would run and trigger the ground detect exception  since the nav stuff runs on a lower frequency. Autopilot_ground_detected should be reset in the nav function anyway.

Finally merged state:  The AUTOPILOT_VERSION message contains: - the version encoded as integer with `MAJOR * 10000 + MINOR * 100 + PATCH` - the complete version string as returned by paparazzi_version  This message is sent once at startup of the autopilot  but can also be registered like any normal telemetry message by adding it to the telemetry airframe file.  The version string is also displayed in the GCS alert window (once per aircraft  unless it changes)...  Also the "build version" is not written to `var/build_version.txt` and the server also writes it to the log.  When building an aircraft it will now warn if the last build version differs from current version. It only checks if the current version number (e.g. 5.3.2) is contained in the full build version string. So it will warn if you changed branches to a different version  but not after e.g. committing only a airframe config change.  You can also run `make print_version` to show the current version (and the warning if build version differs).

Redis is a very fast keystore of various data types with a very simple client interface and also offers a pub/sub mechanism with key matching of any length. This page shows how it works: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/redis/  Other converters like UDP servers exist  but that requires clients to also implement socket level constructs and you don't get any additional logic with those. It's also better to initiate the connection from the client. There are many client libraries available for redis  so that it's possible to interface with paparazzi from a host of languages or environments  even web browsers if you set up a node.js server. Packages that do that exist.  The main reason why I wrote this script is because I want to improve the android tablet client and make a simpler ground control for non-experienced and non-engineer users. Redis then allows me to pick which messages are transferred over either bluetooth/wifi  so that resources are better utilized.  Messages are also "set"  as a key in the keystore  which means that clients connecting later can inspect the values of settings at any point in time and don't need to request or wait for them.  Notes:  - I copied the interface code from the messages_tool.py script in sw/lib/python  because that code converts the ac_id to an int. I also wanted to publish the ground.\* messages and it was giving a ValueError. I'll make an issue about this so it can be discussed and this code removed to use the messages_tool one. It probably needs an option to select which ac_id message type should be used for the callback. - All messages are published to redis  but also "set" as a key value. It overwrites every last one that was set  so this only really works for settings. Messages like "WP_MOVED" get overwritten  but those should be subscribed to anyway (alternatives exist  like adding them to a queue  so the last x can be inspected by other processes that happen to be connecting).  - The redis server must be installed. On Linux  this can be installed through apt. It's also available in brew for mac osx.

It then listens to "ground._" messages only  which are essentially messages from the server related to aircraft and nicely emitted in a periodic interval. A socket.io client like a browser (with Websockets?) can then connect to the nodejs process and subscribe to the messages for a specific ac_id. All ground._ messages are then transmitted to that client. Multiple clients are possible on multiple aircrafts.  Video demonstrating the concept is here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdg2JiZpUI8&feature=youtu.be  Issues and things to ponder: - I noticed a little bug in the ivy_to_redis script. It forwards data directly from the array  which ends up as ['1' 'xxxx' 'yyy' 'zzz']. So I changed that to convert the array back into a string. Maybe you want to put that in as a separate commit. the file is all the way at the end. - There's a lot of files in this one  but there's a great deal of minimized javascript vs. regular js for debugging. The total size of the update is 1M. I suggest reading from the top until you get to "sw/ground_segment/node/package.json"  which is the main code and install files. Then read back from the bottom until "sw/ground_segment/node/public/js/app.js". That's where the real app code is. The javascript code that performs the main functionality is in controllers.js.  So far  it's only an example  but in the current state quite extendable. A little user interface to select the aircraft you want to track and maybe some buttons to execute some basic functions. GMaps also has the possibility to draw polylines and waypoints. If these are used correctly  any update in the model will immediately reflect in the browser window too. So implementing a UI which shows the flight plan and changes to that is pretty straightforward.

Question if we also want to support running multiple instances of the same AHRS algorithm in the same process (meaning compiled into same blob)? That would also require to pass the AHRS implementation struct to it's own update functions. But you start to get to a point where you implement C++ features in C  but in a less readable way... -> only one instance per AHRS implementation for now

That is a Linux-specific set of functions that presents POSIX timers as file descriptors rather than signals.  If the thread runs with a normal priority it can happen that some timer events are missed (and hence sys_time not updated in time). So added a function to set a higher prio for that thread (needs root rights or properly set up limits for the user). In some simple tests no events were missed when running with prio 29 via SCHED_FIFO  even if events would be missed  the sys_tick_handler is called the appropriate number of times (so that the time is correct again after)...

It becomes valid as soon as an attitude is set (via one of the stateSetNedToBodyX functions).     This should be only done by an AHRS/INS after it is aligned. - add possibility to run multiple (currently two) AHRS implementations and switch which one should push the output to the state interface during runtime  `ahrs_init()` and `ins_init()` are now sort of "dispatcher" functions  that init/register the actually used implementation.  As an example using `float_mlkf` as the `PRIMARY_AHRS` and `int_cmpl_quat` as `SECONDARY_AHRS`  in your firmware section of the airframe file:  ```   <subsystem name="ahrs"          type="float_mlkf"/>   <subsystem name="ahrs"          type="int_cmpl_quat">     <configure name="SECONDARY_AHRS" value="int_cmpl_quat"/>   </subsystem> ```  In `ahrs_init()` it calls the ahrs_x_register functions for both. Each of those calls their own ahrs_foo_init and then `ahrs_register_impl(enable_output_function)`  then do the ABI binding and register periodic telemetry functions.  The "enable_output_function" pointer is used to keep a reference to the implementation functions to switch on/off publishing of the output to the state interface. Hence you can call `ahrs_switch(idx)` at runtime to switch the output of the AHRS implementations. E.g. with idx=1 switch to the output of the secondary AHRS (with 0 being the primary) Add the `conf/settings/estimators/ahrs_secondary.xml` settings file to switch them via settings.  Tested on a Lisa/MX 2.0 for those two and seems to work nicely...

Since the callbacks are not const  replace the telemetry_msg struct by typedef for only the name and separate callback array.  This saves ~ 2.5k of RAM with a standard telemetry file  which is really nice if you try to run Paparazzi on a low end board like the CC3D with only 20k RAM.

I suggest to use EAS (very close to CAS for us and easier to compute) for airspeed (the value updating the state interface) and compute TAS (the "real" airspeed) as an extra indication  especially in message instead of tas_factor. One of the reason is that to get a correct TAS you need P  T and P_diff  while EAS/CAS only requires P_diff. Today I flew with an uncalibrated temperature sensor (it was their but not needed) and the result is that my airspeed was completely wrong.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calibrated_airspeed http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indicated_airspeed http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equivalent_airspeed

This adds a more modular and clean way of adding vision modules and calculations. There is a sample image library which is very well documented and could be expanded in the future.  A lot of improvement to the optical flow calculations could be done  but this is just a simple implementation. In the future we could for example keep track of previous found coners  optimize subpixel calculations etc.  What still needs to be done: - [x] Video device should be changeable - [x] The vision message needs to be periodic - [x] More settings for Lucas Kanade calculation (like window size  amount of iterations etc.) - [x] Camera parameters should be changeable - [x] Check LIBC static linking - [x] Run code style formatter

It has functions for reading/writing blocks - A logger module that uses the SD card connected to the SPI port. A python application is included which starts/stops/downloads recordings through telemetry messages. - An implementation of a framework for Test Driven Development  using unity and cmock.  The benefit of this is that a small autopilot such as a Lisa/S can be equipped with a light-weight micro-SD card for high speed logging. The micro-SD card can be soldered directly to SPI pins on the autopilot board. We are now able to log IMU data at high speed  for the development of better control loops on small helicopters.  ![sdlogger_download_app_screenshot](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/8672355/7589136/52446838-f8c1-11e4-9ff6-8ddbdf9d6230.png)  ![sdcard_thumb](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/8672355/7589156/6d8b84fa-f8c1-11e4-8c92-4b820d8510ab.jpg)

Otherwise halt the propagation to not diverge and only set the acceleration. This should only be relevant in the startup phase when the baro is not yet initialized and there is no gps fix yet...  Should fix the last remaining part of #1237 in a more generic and robust way.

It takes the optical flow vectors and evaluates how the distances between corners change over time. This allows to determine the divergence  which is 0 in hover  negative when going up and positive when going down.   The divergence can be used  e.g.  for constant divergence landings  which permit safe landing on surfaces which are not at 0 altitude (roof top for instance).  Main change is the addition of size_divergence.c / h for the calculation of the divergence. The other modifications call the algorithm or pass its values on to the Paparazzi ground station.

Beware of: if you compile a target that unloads some settings or modules (e.g. the sim) after you uploaded to the ap  the `var/aircrafts/<ac>/settings.xml` file that has all usable settings combined will change ~~~and the hence the wrong ones used in GCS and settings prog~~~.  Now the calculation of the MD5sum is taking unloaded settings into account  meaning it will change and warn the user if the last compiled target has different settings.

This should make it possible to limit the main event loop to 1kHz as per #1240.  uart_transmit should always be able to directly write the single byte to the serial device  and hence no need to use the tx queue. Since the uart threads calls select on the fds to check when there is something to read  it will not wake up if there is data in the tx buffer...  Using the tx buffer was previously done because the system timer was generating signals and interrupted the write. Since this is no longer the case it should be fine like this (unless someone adds something that will interrupt the writes again).  Seems to work fine on the bebop and beagle bone black.

The orientation of the sensors is bit different than the Aspirin so for backwards compatibility we need to assign the axis appropriately. To do that we add IMU subsystem makefiles and one additianal raw sensor data field assignement.

We were configuring the pin as floating input. This will result in random behaviour  depending on the charge of the GPIO. The system will decide to set the satellites into bind mode depending on how much moist finger is present on the pin. We want something more decisive than that. :)

All the V1.0 files should work with no problems on the V0.1 hardware. This change should make our life easier in the future  as well as mitigate confusion on the users end. :)  Added the option to change the base tick clock of the servo pwm driver. This makes it possible to use the driver to directly PWM control a brushed motor. See comment on the respective commit for details.  Also added an airframe file that should work with Lisa/S on LadyBird brushed motor nano quadcopter frame. I have tested it on my ladybirds.  No testing has been done on altitude hold and position hold yet. These sections of the airframe file might need some additional improvement in the future. I just copied those sections from TU-Delft airframe that they used/tested on IMAV2013 using a similar nano quadcopter and Lisa/S V0.1.

The glib implementation is copied from glibc which does not implement HUP but only generates an IN event instead (Mac OS default behavior would be to generate HUP & IN events together). The solution I went for was to just check if the channel is empty on IN event  and call the HUP callback.  Overall the whole implementation in the pc_common.ml is bit kludgy and would be nice to streamline/clean up  but I rather change as little as possible for now to not introduce unexpected regressions while fixing this. :)  I tested the fix on current Ubuntu as well as Mavericks  and it "works for me"(TM)

Major improvements are: - better handling of the the baseline messages - use the libsbp as a submodule  Also try the following operations: - compute the base "position" from the global position and the local baseline - send the `BASE_POS` message to module so he can produce pseudo-global DGPS position - send the antenna frontend mode via sbp message  The sending of message to the module is not properly tested and may not work currently. These changes are already improving and should be used instead of the current one. Some help for testing and finishing the dynamic configuration would be much appreciated.

I tried to condense it to a form where it can be useful and understandable for others.  I submitted a paper to the journal of guidance  control and dynamics which covers all the details. In short: By measuring the angular acceleration (which is obtained by deriving and filtering it from the gyroscope) we can measure how much the actual angular acceleration differs from the desired angular acceleration. By multiplying this with the inverse of the actuator effectiveness we get the correct increment of the input that will result in the desired increment in angular acceleration. The main benefit is that disturbances can be rapidly compensated and nonlinear dynamics are controlled better.  It also contains an adaptive algorithm  that will update the actuator effectiveness in flight. You can take off with a drone without knowing the actuator effectiveness and it will learn this during the flight  removing the need for tuning. The only thing you need is a constant for the first order approximation of the motor dynamics. This can be measured with a step response  and a value for the ARDrone is included. I will upload more airframes later.  I hope it will be easy to apply to other airframes  but it is hard to guarantee that the adaptive least mean squares algorithm will converge to the right values  because it depends on the amount of filtering and the adaptation rate (these are linked). In general: if the airframe is well-damped it will work better.  In the airframe file I kept the normal attitude stabilization section  to be able to switch easily. A small problem is that the setpoint defines need the prefix STABILIZATION_ATTITUDE   so they are taken from the STABILIZATION_ATTITUDE section instead of the STABILIZATION_INDI section. I wasn't sure how to get around this.

The dma buffer copies the first byte of the tx buffer into the spi peripheral immediately when the register for slave transaction command is called  that was not immediately clear. I added a comment to the spi_arch to reflect this fact.  After fixing this I found another small "feature" in the send_message function in bluegiga which improves the responsiveness of the tx flow.  I also added code for transactions with the spi3 slave peripheral  compiles but not tested.  I removed the software slave management code. As was implemented if spi2 slave management was set to software all spi slaves would also use software management...  Last and not least I added the firmware needed to run onboard the bluegiga module.

This should keep all the already existing functionality that #1407 doesn't have: - works for UART  UDP  USB serial - more messages supported - support of changing settings - override RC channels - support rotorcraft and fixedwing (except for waypoint changes) - more accurately report current mode  type  etc...  One thing I was wondering about: why add a len field to the SCRIPT_ITEM message? It seems to be totally superfluous to me...  @dewagter @LodewijkSikkel what do you guys think?

Which we are not very likely to use but it needs to be kept in mind.

It only requires a micro-SD card which is soldered directly to the SPI-bus  for example on a lisa/s.  The logger is activated by flipping a switch on the transmitter. Up to 42 logs can be recorded during one session (battery kept connected). The data remains on the card when the battery is disconnected  so that you can replace the battery before downloading data to the computer. Previous logs will be overwritten as soon as the first log is initiated after boot.  The messages to be logged can be selected in the telemetry config file  under the Logger process. Next to that  it is possible to call pprz_msg_send_xxx from anywhere in the code  using a reference to the sdlogger.   Telemetry config example:  ``` <process name="Logger">   <mode name="default">     <message name="ROTORCRAFT_STATUS"      period="1.2"/>     <message name="DL_VALUE"               period="0.5"/>     <message name="ALIVE"                  period="2.1"/>     <message name="IMU_GYRO_SCALED"        period=".002"/>     <message name="IMU_ACCEL_SCALED"       period=".002"/>     <message name="IMU_MAG_SCALED"         period=".1"/>   </mode> </process> ```  A tool is provided to download the data at high speed over UART: ![screenshot from 2015-10-27 14 27 42](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/8672355/10759307/eb0115fc-7cb6-11e5-8cd9-5c8f18a2d79b.png) ![screenshot from 2015-10-27 14 27 51](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/8672355/10759308/ecfdcc38-7cb6-11e5-822c-0d6277cfcc78.png)  Limitations: For now  it can only be used with uart downlink. This is perfect for lisa/s where UART pins are broken out.

See also #1145   This adds a `comp_id` field to the following messages: - AHRS_EULER - AHRS_EULER_INT - AHRS_QUAT_INT - AHRS_RMAT_INT - AHRS_GYRO_BIAS_INT - GEO_MAG  Also register some more message in some of the filters and don't use the value from the state interface to send the attitude in body frame but rather compute it from the actual ahrs output (imu frame). So it will still be correct if muliple AHRS are running and another one is enabled (sets the attitude in the state interface).

This makes it possible to have "meta" names for messages  meaning that name does not need to correspond to an actual message. E.g. if you would register "MYMODULE" and have a "MYMODULE" as message name in the telemetry.xml file  the callback would be registered and you could send any message from within that.  However this requires the strings to be stored in ROM (flash) for comparison...  On small systems (e.g. CC3D  naze32  etc) with very small flash this becomes a major limitation. The proposal here is to drop the "meta" name functionality and instead require to use an actual message name (actually a generated define)  so it can be reduced to a simple numerical id.  So the main question is if we want to sacrifice the flexibility we currently have to reduce ROM size on the very small systems?

This was tested with a bluegiga bluetooth module and a Discovery board to verify its operation. A couple of comments:  The spi slave works really well with spi3  this was fully tested and verified. For some reason when using spi1  after about 1 second paparazzi stops sending data over the datalink although the spi continues to run(I verified this by sending an incrementing value everytime the spi dma returned)  no idea why this is. Although I could clearly see the spi still working I can't say for certain that this works totally for spi1. In my test using spi2 the MISO pin remained low the entire time and didn't work for me  again not sure why  it uses exactly the same code as the other two so...  I added warnings to each spi reflecting the level of testing done thus far.  This will not work out of the box with the discovery board as the spi slave defines in the discovery board are not the alternate function NSS pins as defined by STM. These are true for the LisaM and Lisa MX so this will work for them. I am not sure why the pin definitions are different for these boards. If you like I can push the alternate function definitions as defined by STM. Let me know.  The bluegiga protocol is changed slightly.  The updated spi code still works with the F1 as tested with a lisa/s with bluegiga.  Let me know what you think.

At runtime it will loop over the periodic messages until it finds the matching id (compared to already knowing the index). Also this really makes it impossible to register "meta/alias" messages... but I would argue that even in #1442 this is not nice since you need to provide the #ifndefs in the code...

Now the big question: shall we try to merge this before or after v5.8 stable release ?  My opinion is that before is better: it will let users (both people using stable and dev branches) to prepare their airframes to the new format that may become the standard in later versions.

We have and had frames that vibrate a lot and always had really bad state estimation on these vehicles. @bartslinger suggested it might be because of the gravity heuristic  and it indeed makes a world of difference.   This makes sense  because when there are large vibrations on the accelerometer  the norm will be larger or smaller than zero most of the time. Effectively  the accelerometer is then used a lot less (and randomly more or less at one instant compared to the next sample).  I validated this hypothesis in Matlab by taking the ahrs algorithm with and without gravity heuristic. The difference is very large (on a vibrating platform).  I am not sure how much good this thing is doing compared to the downside I mention above. One possibility is to have the default to be 0. Alternatively  if people really like the heuristic I can also change it in my airframe files.

New messages MULTI_GPS_INT_PRIMARY and MULTI_GPS_INT_SECONDARY report the status of individual GPS units and PIKSI_HEARTBEAT reports the heartbeat for the piksi (since piksi wont send any kind of position messages without lock).  The subsystem switches when the fix of one gps is higher than that of the other.   There is currently only support for one Piksi and one Ublox gps.

The main goal is to allow third party applications to communicate more easily with Paparazzi. It currently provides: - messages definition (custom messages file can still be used) - ocaml and python libraries for ground or embedded CPU usage - C code generator (written in python  based on mavlink generators) to generate C embedded code  Regarding the integration to the main project: - all airborne code is converted - all ocaml programs are converted - audio and aerocomm telemetries have been removed (obsolete)  This pull request is currently at initial review stage and might need some more cleaning

In the generated flight plan  my NED waypoint {-2.0  0.0  1.6} goes to {-2.00  0.04  1.60}  / ENU in meters / . The ENU waypoint is what is used in the navigation.  This seems kind of silly to me  as it should be really simple to go from NED to ENU. The transformation happens in the flight plan generator in the function print_waypoint_enu. In this function the waypoints are first converted to ECEF and then to NED. This is where I think the error is introduced. I suppose this is to get the correct altitude if you use alt or height. But there is no reason to use the east and north values from NED->ECEF->ENU.

Gone is the gps_multi subsystem. Still set with subsystem="gps" type="multi". Now integrated with gps.c/gps.h. Currently  the only supported units are one piksi with one ublox but its still compatible with other implementations of (single) gps's. To add multigps support to a gps unit just change GPS_LINK  add a GpsState and GpsTimeSync to that device and add the proper callback registrations. It's important to note that when using multigps or ublox or piksi  GPS_TYPE_H is undefined and in its place is PRIMARY_GPS_TYPE_H. This is important for compatibility with the other GPS's not addressed in this PR.

The current classic icons are sometimes difficult to see against a black GCS screen(i.e. papgets). The new `flat theme` hopefully improves readability and adds some new icons related to rotorcraft usage vs. fixed wing. Another goal was to introduce new icons without impacting existing users flight plan icon paths and their use of existing `classic` icons.  The new flat theme icons are localized in their own directory named `flat_theme` in `$PAPARAZZI_HOME/data/pictures/gcs_icons`. Along with a new set of icons  this directory contains the master GIMP file named `flat_theme.xcf`.  In addition to the new `flat_theme` directory  the existing set of icons are mirrored in a `classic_theme` directory under  the `$PAPARAZZI_HOME/data/pictures/gcs_icons` directory. By mirroring the data  it provides a migration path from the existing monolithic icon name space to a theme based naming model. So for completeness  a `classic_theme` directory was needed.  Currently  the GCS derives it's icons location from the `gcs_icons_path` variable set in  `$PAPARAZZI_HOME/sw/lib/ocaml/env.ml`  ``` let gcs_icons_path = paparazzi_home // "data" // "pictures" // "gcs_icons" ```  Eventually  the `gcs_icons_path` could be overlayed via the aircraft configuration xml file or other template. Whatever the solution for setting the `gcs_icon_path`  it might be good to have an approach that allows for custom icons at the individual aircraft level.   The approach/solution for setting a theme is open for discussion. There are multiple approaches for solving this issue. In the mean time  by encapsulating theme based icons in their own directories  simple file overlaying techniques can be used to get new icon behaviors.  Note that flight plans and GCS layout files have dependencies on the `gcs_icons_path`. The `strip_icon` attribute in flight plans and the `icon` property in GCS layout files assume icon files are rooted at the location defined by `gcs_icons_path`. Minimizing negative impacts to existing user's flight plans and GCS layout files is important. Hopefully  it would be "transparent".  This is an image of the new "flat_theme" used for strip buttons and as papgets. ![screen shot 2015-05-18 at 10 47 02 pm](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10355071/7807081/2ef04646-033d-11e5-9251-cf5807450746.png)

The Pixhawk can be flashed without external tools (i.e. no JTAG interface is needed). Instead  the PX4 bootloader is kept in place and used by pprz to flash both the AP (stm32f4) and FBW (stm32f1) devices. One important remark is that for the FBW device  currently the computer needs to be connected to the Telem2 port using a FTDI cable. This is because pprz does not support serial communication over USB  or so I've heard.  In any case  the Iris+ drone factory equipped with a Pixhawk flies both on INDI and PID in ATT mode. However  PPRZ currently uses the MPU6000 IMU  which was broken in my Iris+ (and there are indications that maybe in others Iris' and X8's as well). I had to replace it with a fresh Pixhawk.  Also tested with a Pixhawk clone: seems to work just as well.  There are some things on the todo list: 1. Enable USB2serial communication :) 2. Led 3 (which is a led embedded in a separate push button to be mounted somewhere on the air-frame) is used to signal the FBW status. Should be made generic (either by a module  or by a LED def or something) 3. The 1500000 baud rate is necessary to remain compatible with flashing back to original PX4 firmware  however the communication has shown some stability issues. Strange  because original PX4 also uses this baud... The 24MHz external crystal used with the f1 is however outside the specs  so it may have something to do with that. 4. Drivers are missing for:      The spi L3GD20H gyro       The multi color led 5. Only ATT mode has been tested. Autonomous flight using  GPS  baro and magneto has not been done or tested.  Specific to the Iris: 6. Enable the Gimbal controll through the RC

It should run twice as fast as the current implementation.  I tried to rewrite the opticflow_calculator.c a bit so that more methods can be added more easily  since before it was specifically written for fast9/LK implementation. On top of that I tried to use the existing structures as much as possible  so that I can switch between different methods on the fly. A couple of new files are added to the lib folder (edge_flow.c & .h)  Any comments/ suggestions for changes are welcome. @dewagter  can you also take a look at this?   Cheers  K

The Pixhawk can be flashed without external tools (i.e. no JTAG interface is needed). Instead  the PX4 bootloader is kept in place and used by pprz to flash both the AP (stm32f4) and FBW (stm32f1) devices. One important remark is that for the FBW device  currently the computer needs to be connected to the Telem2 port using a FTDI cable. This is because pprz does not support serial communication over USB  or so I've heard.  In any case  the Iris+ drone factory equipped with a Pixhawk flies both on INDI and PID in ATT mode. However  PPRZ currently uses the MPU6000 IMU  which was broken in my Iris+ (and there are indications that maybe in others Iris' and X8's as well). I had to replace it with a fresh Pixhawk.  Also tested with a Pixhawk clone: seems to work just as well.  There are some things on the todo list: 1. Enable USB2serial communication :) ~~2. Led 3 (which is a led embedded in a separate push button to be mounted somewhere on the air-frame) is used to signal the FBW status. Should be made generic (either by a module  or by a LED def or something)~~ 3. The 1500000 baud rate is necessary to remain compatible with flashing back to original PX4 firmware  however the communication has shown some stability issues. Strange  because original PX4 also uses this baud... The 24MHz external crystal used with the f1 is however outside the specs  so it may have something to do with that. 4. Drivers are missing for: The spi LSM303D accelero+magneto  The multi color led 5. Only ATT mode has been tested. Autonomous flight using GPS baro and magneto has not been done or tested.  Specific to the Iris: 6. Enable the Gimbal controll through the RC

However  during flight not. So the baud rate is set to 230400 after 10 seconds.

I searched through the airframes  and there are not many that use rate control. I doubled all the gains and removed rate control for bebop  as rate control over datalink is very difficult due to lag.  The prescaler values should also be default 1 for stabilization quat_int  as they already are for float_quat. However  this will mean updating a large amount of airframes  which will require some scripting. I might have time for this later.

It uses the size divergence from the optical flow algorithm to keep a constant divergence (if set negative the drone will land  0 = hover  and positive is going up). Advantage with respect to a GPS landing is that it will take into account the landing surface  even if it is higher than the ground level (so landing on a roof for instance). The module does not use sonar for the vertical control  so it can be used by tiny drones that do not carry sonar. The module uses a novel theory on seeing distances with just a single camera (no extra sensors) to detect when it should land. So it can also be used by drones to estimate distance with a single camera.

What it does? 1) instead of HOME and MAX_DIST_FROM_HOME the user has to define FlightArea (convex polygon) 2) there is now a compulsory MAX_ALTITUDE attribute in the flight plan 3) if the plane is out of flight area or higher than max altitude  it goes to STANDBY mode 4) STANDBY mode is essentially a modified HOME mode - except instead of going to HOME it goes to STANDBY waypoint (name negotioable) 5) STANDBY waypoint cannot be moved 6) we want to check that STANDBY is defined inside flight area 7) there is also INIT mode of the autopilot  which is triggered upon startup - basically it tells you a reset happened  otherwise it is equivalent to AUTO2/NAV mode locked to circle around STANDBY waypoint. 8) If datalink is lost for more than 30s the plane goes to HOME/STANDBY mode (replaces an optional exception) 9) eventually kills the plane if more than 500 meters outside the flight area (until then try to steer it back)  I made small modifications in the OCaml code  but more guidance here is welcome (especially about how to check if a waypoint is inside flight area). This is more to support a use case for lets say industrial/professional users of pprz  who need better safety than max_dist_from_home circle.  let me know what you think.  Thanks.

Thus  this allows to implement an individual state filter within a paparazzi module: If the define `INS_USE_MODULE` is set in the airframe file  the corresponding init  reset  propagation  and update functions need to be implemented in the module and will be called by the state filter subsystem.

One of the problems that occur when asking for a large change in yaw angle  is that the quadrotor can build up so much angular velocity in the yaw axis  that it can not physically slow down before reaching the yaw setpoint due to saturating. This will result in overshoot.   This can be helped by adding a yaw rate limit  which this PR does for the INDI controller.

In this commit  I add a number of small bug fixes  add some parameters  and add the old optical flow code in  which runs much faster when you don't use pyramids (it skips parts of the border  does not create padding  etc.). Like this people have the choice to run a multi-level pyramid LK optical flow if they have sufficient resources  or run the "flat" version if they don't.  Still  even with all the same settings and the same optical flow code as in the old commit  the optical flow results are not good. This is probably due to the drastically lower frame rate (when there is texture in sight 2-5 FPS as compared to 20/30 FPS for the old code). This difference lies in FAST9  of which the code has actually not changed... So for now I'm assuming something changed in the compilation of the FAST9 code that makes it slower. But I have not been able to pin it down. The additional flags etc. in video_thread.xml do not seem to make a difference.

In past work  we have used texton distributions for instance for obstacle detection. If the entropy of the texton distribution becomes low  this is typically an indication of a close obstacle. This "appearance variation cue" can be a good complement to using optical flow measurements for obstacle avoidance. There are may other uses for texton distributions though  while they are computationally quite cheap.

PRIMARY_GPS (and SECONDARY_GPS) now needs to be UPPERCASE (the first part of the ABI id  e.g. GPS_UBX) This is now only used/needed to resolve GpsId(PRIMARY_GPS) to e.g. GPS_UBX_ID  Also: - remove obsolete/non-functional gps_ublox_hitl and gps_ardrone2  Next steps?: - [x] make gps_sim and gps_nps modules and remove those targets from the "normal" modules - [x] add the sim modules ~~as dependencies so they can be auto-loaded~~ with the new autoload feature? - [x] call the `gps_periodic_check` from the modules for each implementation - [x] get rid of `gps_init` in main?

We often want to derotate our images  to track an object precisely  odometry  optical flow etc.  Today I ran some experiments: between the image capture and the end of optical flow the euler angles can easily get a difference of 17 degrees off (not that useful for optical flow). Even between the start of an image capture and the end (like in this pull request) there can be an offset of about 7.5 degrees.   I propose to let people choose how to deal with this interesting problem. One way to make it easy for them is to get the euler angels at the start of the image capture and at the end of the image capture.   Please let me know what you think about this solution  if you all agree that this is the way to go I will update the image functions in all modules to accept these new arguments.

My proposal is to update our current workflow to get better software earlier in the Paparazzi project  and create issues for "smaller" fixes that are assigned to somebody.   Examples of what I propose would be done:  - we merge https://github.com/paparazzi/paparazzi/pull/1745   then create issues assigned to Kevin to do everything at runtime.  - we merged https://github.com/paparazzi/paparazzi/pull/1737 three days ago (since it was working perfectly)  but created multiple issues (i.e. I used the wrong casing  wrong variable names  that I should add rotation rates  that I made a mistake with the Linux defines etc.).   I am fully aware that having a pull request merged lowers your priority of working on it  but in my eyes this lower priority is justified by having faster improvements to our always changing autopilot. However  this would be a nice topic to discuss on!  Please tell me what you think about this proposed update.

Quick recap; There is a desire to have some vision functions run with less fps than others. It would be great if the priorities can be set between vision functions. For example  textons should run at 5 Hz and optical flow at 30 Hz.  The current setup; For each video device a vision pipeline is created. Modules can attach to this pipeline and process the image in turn  and even modify the image. For example  a color filter can modify the image and one can then view the result in RTP stream. The problem is that  since the vision pipeline is sequential  some modules (like a costly marker detection algorithm) can stall the performance of other vision functions.  I made a proof of concept with @flixr's suggestion in the video_rtp_stream module. The module attaches to the vision pipeline with a routine that copies the image to a buffer if required. The module processes and sends the frames in a separate thread at 10 Hz.  TODO: - Abstract thread functionality into cv.h - Improve thread managing (starting/stopping module)  I think overall this is a good approach  but there are some drawbacks; - Copying the image costs time - The modified image is lost

It ended up that this was because my opencv_bebop submodule had never been initialised and it is not built automatically with make. It is not that useful for new developers wanting to work with opencv or is it good for the CI tests tht will test airframes that use opencv.  Due to the way the opencv_bebop is made it builds quite slowly the first time it checksout but it also tries to build some files every time you build. What I do with this commit is have it that the first time you build paparazzi it will download and build opencv_bebop but only try to rebuild the project if the install folder is missing from the subfolder. This means that the library will only be rebuilt if the user runs 'clean_opencv_bebop' from sw/ext or 'clean' from 'sw/ext/opencv_bebop' folder. Another pitfall of this is the CI build will likely take longer to run. as opencv will be fetched and built for each pull request.  This works for me but is not ideal  it would be great to only build the project if the 'submodule update' actually did something.  This also fast-forwards the submodule to the recent version.

This pull request is to at least make it flyable again in the current master  after I heard several complaints from our lab.  The most important issue was this: The more corners the algorithm tracked  the higher the noise measurement (est velocity error = tracked corners/ max_corners) becomes. However this is not wanted for the ins_hff  since there a higher estimated velocity error results in less trust in that measurementof the Kalman filter. I made a new equation  which actually gives a lower noise measurement with more corners.   In the future there needs to be a better  with optitrack groundtruth backed up  noise model  however this pull request will hopefully give an intermediate solution. I also added an optional median filter if the hff is not used or if more outliers needed to be filtered out.

Not meant to be merged as is  I am looking for feedback and help with improvement.  It was verified in real flight that the simulation is close enough so it can be trusted (we are actually publishing a paper about it soon).  **Features:** - simulates fixedwing flight with external INS (in this case Vectornav) - allows full flight simulation on the actual hardware (closest to real flight) - uses flight gear for visualisation - saves flight data both in the Ground Station (telemetry low frequency data) and as a csv file (high-frequency data)  **Limitations:** - fixedwing only - hardcoded position & model settings - has to be compiled separately (e.g. from Eclipse  not from Pprz center) - also requires boost  which some might consider as a limitation  **TO DO**: - [ ] integrate with paparazzi make process (so it includes the right flight plan data etc) - [ ] add VTOL option (?) - [ ] integrate Gaiga Environment simulator and Ivy messages listening (so you can control it easily)  As I said  feedback  suggestions and help implementing the last issue is very much appreciated!

The problem of using the HHF filter is that it also effect the reaction of the controls (for some reason there is too much dependency on the process model but I can't change the noise factors). I think that it is wise to filter vision results separate from the state filters. Right now it is implemented for optical flow  but later it can be used for tracking as well. I hope you will agree - derotation correction factor: there seems to be an error between the calculated derotation flow by the gyro and the calculated flow. Now it has been fitted together and for the bebop a correction term has to be added (credits to @mmoiozo for figuring this out).  This has been test flown with two bebops.  cheers    Kimberly

The commit is rather large  but there are few separate commits that could be merged immediately: - 9a9c58bc4424594593a7f45f06a49376c5dde606 Added AggieAir control panel (simple) - support for higher baudrates & minor fixes in existing AP code (5e1576c27699fb5839ea44413d38acf673c1fa11 27393daecfefc01303b58935d4e72d822080f987 8dd3699f96a50466be965f05eb1c7f14cf10f5fe 2895ec12a5f65926642a3d7502bc6aced51e103c) - I added a "flight logger" module -> it is crucial for HITL  basically it sends telemetry messages (mainly COMMANDS) over a serial link. We also use it for logging (we have an Overo that saves data on SD card) 576169cdbe4c6e4116d32fcdf491cd5e3d766be6 - Then finally I wanted to be able to use NPS as SITL and HITL and have it modular - so far I have to add a flag to the airframe config file  I would prefer having a separate HITL target eventually (and rename NPS to SITL) - `nps_main.c` and `nps_hitl_main.c` are using threads and the timing/etc seems to work fine. It is mostly a proof of concept now  I am hoping to get some feedback from you before I clean it up more. Eventually I would like to have support for Xsens and other INS units (not just Vectornav).  I ll be on vacations next week  but I was hoping you could have a look at it in the meantime. @flixr @gautierhattenberger @deonblaauw ? Thanks.

Regardless  this tries to make it a bit more robust if you re-use the same abi_event for consecutive AbiBindMsgX calls:  If AbiBindMsgX is called multiple times _consecutively_  the event/callback is now only added if it is different from the last one added...  This should at least fix the endless loop since the event->next can't point to itself anymore...    Should fix #1924 in a rudimentary way... but would still be possible to bind multiple times using the same abi_event if another bind for the same message happens in between.  Bottom line: make sure that your code doesn't call AbiBindMsg with the same abi_event struct multiple times!

This mode makes sense in case of e.g. fixed wing operation  which often don't necessarily require stabilization to be human-controllable. However  for a quadrotor such as the Iris+ it's useless  unless an IMU is added to the FBW processor such as in the Outback board. (and although the Pixhawk has two IMU's  both are connected to the AP)    The Pixhawk has an auxiliary processor (its got an STM32F1 FBW processor and an STM32F4 AP processor) to take care of the servo commands and RC receiver  and a main processor which runs the AP and stuff. The RC commands are passed on to the AP by the FBW. And before that happens  the FBW interprets the RC commands in order to not depend on the AP. So  if the RC command says FBW  the AP cannot override.    Currently there is no define to disable RC-Direct ( -->"FBW mode") from an airframe xml. This PR adds one.

The RTL switch negates the value of the mode switch.    This PR enables pprz to distill the mode unregardless of the STL switch position.    If anyone knows a better place for the RADIO_MODE_3x2 define  that would be great. Would be nice to have that in the rc xml instead of the airframe xml?

This allows for online individual actuator control effectiveness estimation and inversion  as well as better saturation handling. The INDI controller as it was previous is renamed to 'simple'.  I think this is an essential step in making a more complete controller. This will allow us to do much better control allocation  for which we already did successful experiments. I will still update the code to make it look a bit better  for instance the hardcoded matrices should go of course. But perhaps you can already see if you like how the controller is interfacing with the actuators instead of commands  or if there is a better way.

As this is the first time I'm creating a C++ interface to be used by C I am having a lot of doubts about how to proceed.   In the end we want to have a camera interface which every camera implements in a c++ class. Next to this we still need a binding with c... so we will call a function mt9f_camera_resize(w h)  which then takes the camera object and calls resize on that one?  As I don't have that much time to spend on this: what would the fastest way be to get a simple working program?

In most cases the function is only supposed to be called only once though...    This has led to a state where a lot of functions that are supposed to be called from the flight plan have an additional `return false` to make them `call`-able.    From just looking at the flight plan it is hard to determine if a function will indeed be only called once or is actually called each time the flight plan navigation is run until it is "done" (returns false).  To make this distinction more explicit and hopefully more clear (and the code cleaner)  one should use `call` only when really needed and `call_once` otherwise.    This PR removes the "dummy" `return false` from a lot of functions  hence mandating that `call_once` is used for them. Eventually we shouldn't have any cases like that anymore...  All flight plans were updated accordingly.    The most common case where `call` still has to be used are navigation routines a la `nav_x_run`.    This should be "backwards safe" (not backwards compatible) in the sense that if you try use `call` for a function that needs to be called with `call_once` (since it now returns void)  you will get an "invalid use of void expression" error:  ```  In file included from firmwares/rotorcraft/navigation.c:40:0:  /home/flixr/code/paparazzi/var/aircrafts/Quad_LisaMX/ap/generated/flight_plan.h: In function 'auto_nav':  /home/flixr/code/paparazzi/var/aircrafts/Quad_LisaMX/ap/generated/flight_plan.h:129:9: error: invalid use of void expression           if (!

It has some R7008SB SBUS2 receiver   which is different than some other SBUS2 receivers  which is different then SBUS receivers. To boring to go into  but apparantely PX4 has a better implementation so I borrowed some info there. This works fine for this equipment  but would be interesting to test on current sbus stuff.  2. The bird can glide pretty well  but only if the wing is locked in a certain position. I created a module  which reads a wing position sensor  which can lock the wing exactly right. However  this is done by setting the thrust to a fixed value just before attempting to lock it (there are some speed inertia dynamics to account for)  and then after a rotation sets the thrust to 0 (which actively breaks the motor). I could not think of a nice way to do everything from the module code  so  I needed to change the autopilot a bit. It's working fine  but if anyone can think of something better...?    Its not been flight tested yet as that is scheduled for over two weeks  so I would like to add this to pprz already now.

Some extra tools and modification:  - angle of attack and sideslip update in NPS  - second angle of attack (e.g. sideslip) in aoa_pwm driver  - Meso-NH reader to feed NPS with realistic meteorological (wind) data    The algorithm itself is still an ongoing research topic and might be updated in the future. It shouldn't be used for "normal" operations.

So if you try to use this  you have to add the baro_board.xml module (otherwise it will warn you if your board normally has a baro onboard).  Only the microjet_lisa_m and quadrotor_lisa_mx are updated to have the baro_board module loaded right now...  This is mostly meant to have something to look at for discussion about how we should handle things like automatically loading the correct drivers according to the board that you have.  This module does basically the same as the subsystem makefile before: a raw makefile section that needs to list all available boards with their baro options.  Maybe we can instead think of another way to have some modules automatically loaded  so we really have only one module for each baro?

Several fixes have provided increased usability (#1836 #1864) however they require calibration and regular re-calibration of the magnetometer and as far as I heard do not allow for long duration flights due to magnetometer drift (@OpenUAS @bartremes)    In this module an unscented kalman filter is implemented based on [TRICAL](http://github.com/sfwa/TRICAL) to calibrate the magnetometer online. This should prevent magnetometer drift during flight.     I have been testing this non-flying on several bebop2's and it seems to provide accurate calibration. However due to weather conditions I haven't been able to do any NAV flight tests.     It would be awesome if anybody else with access to either bebop1 or bebop2 could verify this.    **Current limitations:**    - Currently this is only tested on the bebop2 since it is the only platform I am currently able to test.  - I have not flown in NAV mode yet due to windy conditions in the Netherlands. During RC ATT flight the bebop does provide the correct heading  - The UKF should also be able to correct for motor current disturbances so mag_current_coef shouldn't be necessary (this hasn't been thoroughly investigated yet!)

This currently seems the best option.   Alternatively I could address the FIXME in the AbiSendMsgOPTICAL in opticflow_module.c:  "// FIXME  scale to some quality measure 0-255"    However  if we change the float noise_measurement in the struct opticflow_result_t to uint8_t noise_measurement to optimize for speed  while multiplying the relevant variables by 255  other code  i.e. the filtering in the edgeflow algorithm would break as float noise_measurement is used in calculations.    **NB** I also updated the type declaration in optical_flow_landing.c to prevent compile errors.

Most fixes are clear by the commit message  if not please ask why I did certain things.    Note that for the RESOLUTION_FACTOR in opticflow_calculator.c I'm quite sure it is implemented now as it was intended. However I am not fully sure it is sufficient  as information is lost earlier regardless due to the use of integers instead of floats.    Apart from those I have a few remarks/questions with respect to things that might improve speed a bit  or remain a possible problem. However I have not fixed them as I am not sure if my proposed solution is valid/matters.    1)  I believe line 201 in edge_flow.c is useless  given line 181:  https://github.com/ETitus/paparazzi/blob/EdgeFlow_fixes/sw/airborne/modules/computer_vision/lib/vision/edge_flow.c#L201  Removing line 201 might result in a slightly faster run?    2)  looking at line 124 and 143 in edge_flow.c  the for loop goes over c=-1  c=0 and c=1. But the loop does nothing useful per definition for c=0  because Sobel[c + 1] * something will always be 0 as Sobel[0+1]=Sobel[1]=0.  I am not sure how much  or actually little computation time this will save  but having the for loop only loop c=-1 and c=1 could prevent useless computations.  https://github.com/ETitus/paparazzi/blob/EdgeFlow_fixes/sw/airborne/modules/computer_vision/lib/vision/edge_flow.c#L124    3)  If one is to switch between LK and EF frequently the if statement in line 451 in opticflow_calculator.c is run multiple times  mallocing space  that is not being freed somewhere.  This can either be moved to the init function  and set to 0 when the if in 451 is run.  https://github.com/ETitus/paparazzi/blob/EdgeFlow_fixes/sw/airborne/modules/computer_vision/opticflow/opticflow_calculator.c#L451    The same goes for the if in line 240  where 2 images are created and not freed upon switching away.    https://github.com/ETitus/paparazzi/blob/EdgeFlow_fixes/sw/airborne/modules/computer_vision/opticflow/opticflow_calculator.c#L240

The problem is that the waypoints are handled differently in each  and Copilot has to process the WP_MOVED message.    I wanted to take care of this at the makefile level  rather than having a bunch of `ifdefs` but I needed to pass the information about which firmware is being used (hence added the `FIRMWARE` variable in the makefile). It would be nice if this was eventually handled by the generators and I didn't have to use the `<raw>` section in the module xml file  but it works fine for now.

Unlike JSBsim  Gazebo can provide a 3D environment and camera sensors. The video_thread module has been modified so that Gazebo's camera images can be used during simulation. This means that it is now possible to perform closed-loop simulations with vision-based control schemes.    Changes:  - Addition of Gazebo FDM    - conf/modules/fdm_gazebo.xml    - sw/simulator/nps/nps_fdm_gazebo.cpp    - conf/Makefile.nps  - Modification of video_thread_nps and pc_sim board to simulate cameras    - sw/airborne/boards/pc_sim.h    - sw/airborne/modules/computer_vision/video_thread_nps.c    - sw/airborne/modules/computer_vision/video_thread_nps.h    - sw/airborne/modules/computer_vision/viewvideo_nps.c  - Example world and model for Gazebo    - conf/simulator/gazebo/models/ardrone/model.config    - conf/simulator/gazebo/models/ardrone/ardrone.sdf    - conf/simulator/gazebo/world/ardrone.world  - Example files for Paparazzi    - conf/airframes/examples/ardrone2_gazebo.xml    - conf/conf_example.xml  - Changed .xml files to allow compilation for nps    - conf/modules/cv_colorfilter.xml    - conf/modules/video_rtp_stream.xml    Known issues:  - Rotorcraft only  control surfaces are not yet supported.  - AHRS/INS need to be bypassed as these do not yet function correctly. Probable causes are the lack of atmospheric measurements and/or incorrect magnetometer readings from Gazebo.  - Video streaming might not work correctly  see issue [2068](https://github.com/paparazzi/paparazzi/issues/2068).  - Starting from version 8  Gazebo has an atmospheric model incl. wind  drag  lift etc.. This is not used yet.    Demo:  1. Install gazebo 7 or 8: `sudo apt-get install gazebo8 libgazebo8-dev`.  2. Run ./start.py to select conf/conf_example.xml and control_panel_example.xml  3. Select the ardrone_gazebo aircraft  build for nps and start the simulation.  4. Run `gzclient` in a new terminal window to view the simulation.  5. Control the UAV using the GCS as usual.  6. Connect to the video RTP stream as described on the [wiki](https://wiki.paparazziuav.org/wiki/AR_Drone_2#Option_1:_Simple_low_quality_MJPEG_over_RTP)    More usage information can be found in conf/modules/fdm_gazebo.xml.

The idea is that `hitl` is de facto `nps` target  except it has a different name (and uses a few different files). So I want to have `nps_common.makefile` and then `nps.makefile` and `hitl.makefile` (see below).    Then I have to have a toplevel `Makefile.hitl` that only calls `Makefile.nps` and that should be it - right?    I can'get it to compile  I suspect there is some change with generators that I have to add the target to?

It allows you to specify priorities for different control objectives through a weighting in the cost function. This is why it has weighted least squares (WLS) in the name. Prioritizing parts of the control objective (pitch and roll over yaw for instance) is important for stable flight when there are saturations. Normally  the optimal control input can be found with the pseudo-inverse. However  when there are saturations  WLS-control allocation will satisfy the important parts of the control objective at the cost of the unimportant parts.    The optimal solution for this cost function is found using the active set method  which requires solving multiple least squares problems. For this we are using a (trimmed down) library from John Burkardt (http://people.sc.fsu.edu/~jburkardt/cpp_src/r8lib/r8lib.html). I wasn't sure what header we need for these files.    Probably I can still improve some stuff here and there  but I wanted to get the ball rolling with this pr...

Re-detection will now happen when tracked corners reach a low threshold  and only in the region(s) that have a low amount of corners.  It also fixes the already existing method which detected corners on the new frame and then projected them to the previous one to track them again.  The last commit introduces an FPS parameter to all computer vision modules such that the video listeners that they attach to the camera with the `cv_add_to_device` function can operate at a lower frequency than the camera frame rate. This can be useful in cases like the optical flow where a high frame rate could accumulate error. Note that many of those modules could not be compiled out of the box  but the feature was added so that the call to the `cv_add_to_device` would not be a source of error later on.

If the user runs a mission with different trajectories  then there is not need to change the gains on the fly anymore  e.g. poly survey (see later). The user can also tune the gains separately and save them in its airframe.    - More primitives regarding ellipses  sin and lines have been added. In particular  now there is 'gvf_segment' where the aircraft tracks a segment defined by two points.    - The set NAV now has 'nav_survey_polygon_gvf_run()'  which does exactly the same as 'nav_survey_polygon_run()'  but employing the GVF instead of the Carrot. One of the advantages is that during the segments  the aircraft really tracks the line and it is not going to a waypoint (Carrot).

Re-detection will now happen when tracked corners reach a low threshold  and only in the region(s) that have a low amount of corners.  It also fixes the already existing method which detected corners on the new frame and then projected them to the previous one to track them again.  The second commit introduces an FPS parameter to all computer vision modules such that the video listeners that they attach to the camera with the `cv_add_to_device` function can operate at a lower frequency than the camera frame rate. This can be useful in cases like the optical flow where a high frame rate could accumulate error. Note that many of those modules could not be compiled out of the box  but the feature was added so that the call to the `cv_add_to_device` would not be a source of error later on.

This enables the possibility to also use the flight plan when no perfect 3D fix is known (like GPS or OptiTrack)  since most are focused position waypoints. Since indoor autonomous flight is becoming more common application  this module can be very helpful as it turns the flight plan into a state machine  which can reactively respond to its environment. I have been using this principle for my flights for a while now so therefore I want to merge it into paparazzi master branch.    This pull request includes:  -  flight_plan_guided module  - example airframe with the module included (for gazebo simulator)  -  example flight plan which uses the module (I added it to the conf_example.xml  so you can try it out yourselves)  -  adjusted the color filter to send an ABI message if an color (obstacle) is detected. It serves as an example how this detection can be used in the flight plan.    I hope that you also find this module useful and please comments if there are some issues or if it has to be adjusted for more general use within paparazzi

This was found to be necessary to prevent large outliers from being propagated through the ins (the sonar is typically trusted quite heavily).  This outlier detector will also delay the propagation of true vertical height transitions for eg when flying over a table  the gradient threshold has been chosen to remove temporary outliers and not delay true transitions for very long.

In order to fit the RAM memory footprint on the 32K RAM of the STM32F37  the thread working area sizes have been reduced. It all seems to work without fault  so I don't think it is necessary to increase the size for larger chips such as the F7.   Another thing is that the PPRZ_TRIG_CONST needed to be defined as CONST. This placed the sin integer lookup table on flash. The other defines such as PPRZ_TRIG_INT_COMPR_FLASH do not seem to have any effect. Of course  the new define PPRZ_TRIG_INT_USE_FLOAT also works.    The x-vert has been flight tested. It can hover manually. Further steps (autonomous  forward flight) are planned. A wiki page about the x-vert is in the works.    Known problems:  The X-vert ESCs provide motor feedback  but this is not yet read out  The X-vert may have a current sensor  but it is not yet read out  The X-vert board has an CYRF chip for radio control  but this is not supported yet in this PR.  The Chibios stm32F37 implementation has a problem with the hard FPU. When enabled  totally weird results happen.

While conversions in paparazzi are fine  it depends on timing (e.g. compile time/before geo-init/after geoinit) and other constraints like e.g. the accuracy of the ground level defined in the flightplan if or not the intended goal is achieved.  _Definitions_:  [Paparazzi Wiki: Altitude/Height](http://wiki.paparazziuav.org/wiki/Demystified/Altitude_and_Height)  ![Ellipsoid-Geoid](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/00/Geoida.svg/730px-Geoida.svg.png)  **GPS:** - alt = above ellipsoid (2) (which is NOT sea level and is not used in aviation) - hmsl = above sea level (5) = geoid = aviation altitude  ![Height/Alt](http://www.ulmpassion.ch/index_html_m73f33271.png)  **Aviation:** - alt = above mean sea level  which is more or less equal to the geoid (neglecting the ocean surface topography) - height = above local terrain (in paparazzi: SRTM)  **Conclusion** In case barometric and gps altitude are perfectly converted then: - ellipsoid = gps.alt = never used in aviation - geoid = gps.hmsl = aviation-altitude = QNH altitude - flight level = altidute in case the pressure at sea level was 1013.25 - QFE = height above 'geo-init' or take-off field - aviation height = height above local terrain = SRTM (not available onboard yet in paparazzi) - height above obstacle = sonar/radar height  All of the above can have slightly different scalings depending on the sensor used.  The idea of this pull request is to be able to set waypoint and limiting heights using any reference: e.g. set WP height above terrain -> using SRTM model the altitude changes with position. Or when waypoints have a QFE height  then skipping geo-init is made impossible. Or in the indoor flight arena  waypoints height above ground can be set.

It is important to define the noise characteristics to suit the drone being used but once done the performance is quite good.

This dongle should be combined with the extra_pprz_dl module with:  ``` <module name="extra_dl.xml">       <configure name="EXTRA_DL_PORT" value="UDP1"/>       <define name="UDP1_PORT_IN" value="5000"/>       <define name="UDP1_PORT_OUT" value="5001"/>       <define name="UDP1_HOST" value="127.0.0.1"/> </module> ```  I am not sure if this is the correct place for this so please advise.

The method is inspired by the method in the article: de Croon  G.C.H.E.  and Nolfi  S. (2013  May). Act-corner: Active corner finding for optic flow determination. In Robotics and Automation (ICRA)  2013 IEEE International Conference on (pp. 4679-4684). IEEE.    The main idea of this particular implementation  called ACT-FAST  is that actively scanning the image allows to:  1. Skip uniform areas in the image. If these areas are contiguous  many non-corners will never be evaluated.  2. Follow edges. Typically  following an edge will bring an agent to a corner.    These two simple rules lead to a significant lower number of corner evaluations  while still detecting a reasonable number of corners. Moreover  since the agents scanning the image start on a grid  corners will be quite well-distributed over the image. Each step of the agent starts by classifying the agent location as a corner or not with FAST. For bigger images (e.g.  640 x 640)  the computational advantage of ACT-FAST over the normal  exhaustive application of FAST becomes significant (in the order of a factor > 10). On a Bebop 2 I measured a processing time of ~0.003 seconds compared to ~0.04 seconds for exhaustive FAST corner checking.     The code here is part of the following publication:  de Croon  G.C.H.E. "ACT-FAST: efficiently finding corners by actively exploring images."  in submission.

Gazebo's GetWorldLinearAccel() did not seem to take the ardrone's velocity_decay (drag) into account  instead it measured the drone's acceleration *without drag* which resulted in incorrect measurements  in-flight (the drone's acceleration in world frame did not go to zero when the drone reached its steady-state velocity).    Fixed by manually deriving the drone's world velocity over time  as in [Gazebo's own IMU implementation](https://bitbucket.org/osrf/gazebo/src/e26144434b932b4b6a760ddaa19cfcf9f1734748/gazebo/sensors/ImuSensor.cc?at=default&fileviewer=file-view-default#ImuSensor.cc-370).

It is prettier now xD. I have also added two examples for the configuration file.    This script sends two messages for setting 'gvf_ell_a' and 'gvf_ell_b'. Because in this version we deal only with circles  both messages have the same payload (the radius of the circle to be tracked). However  it is possible to cover the more general case of ellipses with a small modification  and then 'gvf_ell_a' and 'gvf_ell_b' will be different.    This modification is something that I have to think a bit how to include it :P. If the bandwitdh is an issue  then the user should use the module for the decentralized version.    edit  -----    I have also rewritten (and tested) the initialization of tables for the decentralized case. Now both cases  centralized and decentralized  can use the same config files thanks to jetson.

Upon investigating it turns out that this is the case since https://github.com/paparazzi/paparazzi/pull/2079  where the feature management was introduced  later fixed in https://github.com/paparazzi/paparazzi/pull/2087. However the feature management is turned off by default.    Furthermore the pyramid was set two 2 layers standard.    Testing on an ARDrone and Bebop alongsides showed that the Bebop had no issue with the code and was still flying arround 90 FPS(camera maximum) while the ARDrone dropped from 30-60 FPS(camera max) to 2-5 FPS.     In this pullrequest I set the pyramid back to 0  which improved FPS to about 10-15 FPS. I also tried to turn on feature management  which had the same result. Combining these two changes returned the FPS to 30-60 FPS for an ARDrone.    I changed the setting in all ARDrone conf files that include the vision  to leave Bebop untouched.

If for all samples in    for (uint16_t sample = 0; sample < n_samples; sample++)   distance_1 is 0  then the newly introduced used_samples remains 0  leading to a division by 0 in the mean_f function in:  https://github.com/paparazzi/paparazzi/blob/master/sw/airborne/modules/computer_vision/opticflow/size_divergence.c#L118  This value then messes up filters where the size_divergence is used  for example OF_Landing and forthcoming OF_Hover.    The suggested fix sets the mean_divergence to 0. Though I am NOT sure if this is the correct behavior to fix it.

All ins modules set the state.tum_origin_f directly so it seems more logical to use that variable instead of the nav variables.  Additionally  the rotorcraft nav doesn't use similar variables so I thought this may help with future merging of navigation firmware.  Note: This implementation only removes the nav variables  there still isn't an implementation to check the zone and update the utm_origin_f when the zone changes.

The accompanying pprzlink PR: https://github.com/paparazzi/pprzlink/pull/75    Currently only the arming by throttle is fully done: the kill-switch-arming is not implemented  and  the yaw-arming is not tested.    About the yaw arming: the procedure has changed slightly: before this PR centering all sticks was only required during the initialization state. I think it should be required during all arming steps  otherwise it can easily happen that the drone will violently flip at arming. I think it has happened to me often actually. Now that the user is informed about why the drone is not arming  I think that cancels the biggest disadvantage of this extra hassle.  Let me know if this is acceptable  and I will try to test yaw arming ASAP as well.    Question: the throttle arming checks the mode and whether the AP has unarmed  yaw-arming doesn't do that... Does not seem correct...?      In the future I suggest to also not allow arming the drone if the battery is critical or outside the geofence. Any other cases?

Included are properly tuned airframes for ARDrone2 and Bebop 1  functions for monocular hover and a more general function file.

Instead all variables/structures are passed on as values or pointers where useful.    The module contains a summary of how to tune the module for any drone specific  as well as links to the respective theoretic background. The airframes are added to the TU Delft config and 'tagged' for successful flight on PPRZ Master(last Friday).    All feedback on form or functions is welcome. Please note that the 'hardcoded' landing functions are not removed yet  this will be done in a future pull request together with the authors/users of those files.

While reading the some Python code of the project  I thought I might contribute to PEP8 compliance and Python 3 compatibility. Willing to do more of it as I learn paparazzi and maybe enhance the Python coding standards document. Really hoping I can help on this great project !!

Now  the normal UART driver is used instead of the specific code. It  makes it possible to use on only arch  including ChibiOS.  Binding is also possible  but for boards using ChibiOS and SD logger  it  is recommanded to disable it for the binding process as the LSE clock  required by the RTC is longer to start (bind pulses should be issued  before 200ms after power up).  The configuration is backward compatible and some defines in the boards'  header could be even removed. Only Apogee  Chimera and Elle0 have been  updated as it is the only board tested for now. There is no harm to keep  the old defines.

With this  you give a side stick to arm the motors  this will start the motors at minimum speed. Your stick controls will not be fed through to the controller till you return the stick to the center. When disarming  you reduce the throttle to minimum and give full side stick till the motors stop. You first have to return the stick to center before you can re-arm.    I also add an explicit autopilot_set_in_flight(false) command when starting the motors. This is not strictly necessary since the in_flight check checks if the throttle is retarded but I think this is nice just in case the in_flight code is changed in the future.

Moving the timing from the start to the end of the cv computation loop helps the timing of the loop when the computational time is varying.    I also made the requested frequency of the bottom camera settable with MT9V117_TARGET_FPS. It is more efficient to limit the speed with this rather than with OPTICFLOW_FPS if no other processes are using the bottom camera.    Running the main loop at double the ap frequency seems more appropriate than the arbitrary 1000Hz that was there before. This is now also settable using the POLLING_PERIOD define.    Lastly  there is an interesting program on the bebop (2) called ephemerisd. When the parrot dragon software is running it uses about 2% of the cpu but once paparazzi is launched it jumps to 50%. I am not entirely sure what this program does or why it uses to much processing. If you Google ephemeris you get something with GPS satellite tables so I think it is safe to say that if you are flying inside you can safely close this program. For now I put it inside of an i#f PRIMARY_GPS == GPS_DATALINK. Let me know if you have a better protection check.

However  the current code is not robust - leading to faulty large altitude estimates and very large velocities. This leads to large control inputs  which result in worse vision  which result in even worse estimates... you get the drift.    So  in this pull request  I just changed some things in the bebop2_opticflow.xml (it was set not to update sonar on AGL  etc.) and the opticflow_module.c files to make the hover mode work again out of the box (this was broken due to the addition of the vertical velocity).     In the future  this pull request should be followed up by a more fundamental solution that takes the reliability of the divergence into account for estimating the vertical velocity well. For now  though  this pull request will allow people to fly with optical flow again.

This PR proposes that if so defined by the user  the filter can be inversed allowing the VFF to estimate the obstacle height from the difference between the baro and sonar measurements allowing the vehicle to fly at constant barometric altitude over obstacles. The sonar measurements help to filter the barometer measurements and provide more consistent vertical speed estimates. This filter has already been test flown in an obstacle filled environment to good effect.  One observed side effect is that the barometric pressure in an environment changes over time which would cause the vehicle to have a biases altitude. To fix this I propose to augment the Kalman filter with an additional state to estimate both the sonar and barometer offset using time scale separation  fast changes in sonar alt are likely obstacles but time averaged readings are likely the ground truth (pun intended) and should be added as a baro offset. I will implement and test this shortly. Any feedback is appreciated.

These can be used to convert image coordinates from distorted fisheye lenses to undistorted coordinates and back  taking into account the camera calibration matrix and the distortion of the specific lens. The distortion function is the one from Dhane  P.  Kutty  K.  & Bangadkar  S. (2012). A generic non-linear method for fisheye correction. International Journal of Computer Applications  51(10). (invertible fisheye model)  as it is an invertible model.     I also made a module  undistort_image  that uses the functions to undistort a whole image. This is quite a slow process  so it is not really advisable to use this in a vision pipeline leading to control. However  it can be used to find the right undistortion parameter k  and shows that the undistortion functions work.    I have tested the functions and module on a Bebop 2  using the front image. I added a specific airframe to the TU Delft airframes for this purpose.

The code allows a Parrot Bebop drone to detect racing gates and pass through a sequence of them at a reasonably high speed (1.8 m/s).     This first pull request contains two things:  1. The snake gate detector code  which is a computationally efficient method to find (close-to) square gates in an image.  2. A cv_detect_gate module  which runs the snake gate detector  allows to tune the color filter parameters  and allows to play with various other parameters of the snake gate detection.

Indeed the compilation works fine if I *dont* use any C++ code  but that is not very helpful.    I am using a demo module with code borrowed from PX4/Matrix library https://github.com/PX4/Matrix - eventually I might want to use this code in `sw/ext` but for now lets assume this is OK (just ignore the files)    When I compile this code (AggeAir conf / Iris airfame) it fails at the linker script with:  ```  /usr/bin/../lib/gcc/arm-none-eabi/5.4.1/../../../../arm-none-eabi/lib/armv7e-m/softfp/libc.a(lib_a-sbrkr.o): In function `_sbrk_r':  sbrkr.c:(.text._sbrk_r+0xc): undefined reference to `_sbrk'  /usr/bin/../lib/gcc/arm-none-eabi/5.4.1/../../../../arm-none-eabi/lib/armv7e-m/softfp/libc.a(lib_a-abort.o): In function `abort':  abort.c:(.text.abort+0xa): undefined reference to `_exit'  /usr/bin/../lib/gcc/arm-none-eabi/5.4.1/../../../../arm-none-eabi/lib/armv7e-m/softfp/libc.a(lib_a-signalr.o): In function `_kill_r':  signalr.c:(.text._kill_r+0x10): undefined reference to `_kill'  /usr/bin/../lib/gcc/arm-none-eabi/5.4.1/../../../../arm-none-eabi/lib/armv7e-m/softfp/libc.a(lib_a-signalr.o): In function `_getpid_r':  signalr.c:(.text._getpid_r+0x0): undefined reference to `_getpid'  collect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status  ```    What I gathered from the web  it has something to do with libraries not being in the right order. @flixr you mentioned that g++ somehow reorders libraries  can we tell the linker which order it should use?    For ChibiOS (AggieAir conf/ Minion Lia) this fails with:  ```  g++: error: unrecognized command line option '-mthumb'  ...  arm-none-eabi-gcc: fatal error: no input files  ```    Here is where the cpp files should be included: https://github.com/paparazzi/paparazzi/blob/cpp_support/conf/Makefile.chibios#L207 but I am not sure how to specify them - @gautierhattenberger ? Also I believe that some flags will have to be modified.

The default tool configuration will be in individual files (one for each tool) in conf/tools/.  You can then override the default configuration in your control_panel.xml (eg. to change the default arguments or add custom tools). You can also add the `blacklisted="true"` attribute to the tools in your control_panel.xml to hide it in the paparazzi center.    This way  you will be able to see the new tools without changing your control_panel.xml  and you can make a custom configuration without affecting the default one.

Why is this useful? Besides being an interesting demonstration of technology  the main benefit is that Rust brings high level language abstraction (types  traits  generics) into embedded world without the need of garbage collection. Since Rust is memory safe  we don't have to worry (at least not too much) about using heap for data allocation/deallocation. Rust is also fast (zero-cost abstraction  no GC)  so performance is comparable with native C code. And the Rust compiler checks lots of things for you  so it is harder to make a mistake. So I am hoping Rust can make writing autopilot code more productive  and also safer.    The current state is:   - Rust's allocator is backed by ChibiOS's API for heap allocation/deallocation  - Simple rust module is being called     TODO:  - better way of building the rust libraries (currently I need to call `xargo` separately  not sure yet how to wrap it into the build system)  - create a paparazzi-compatibility Rust crate that has the relevant C calls (for state/control etc)    The goal is to create a new autopilot (similar to the "static autopilot") with perhaps some new cool control system that is easier to create in Rust.    I am looking for early feedback. @gautierhattenberger

This is an old attempt to copy the Local Position Estimator (INS) from Pixhawk into Paparazzi. Back in time I didn't have C++ support  now it would be much nicer with Eigen. LPE uses lidar and sonar data on top of (optional) GPS to be used for sub-meter precision.    If I remember it right   the performance was comparable with the other INS's  but I am not sure if it was actually great.    Anybody interested in polishing this or using it?

The only possible issue might be in the hybrid guidance:  - quat setpoint should now have the proper value  but since the "wrong" value was currently compensated later in the code it shouldn't change anything  - euler setpoint should be correct now  but it is unclear if it was even used with hybrid guidance (it shouldn't)  - hybrid guidance from master is currently not much used apparently and might need some extra cleaning and better integration anyway  better have this part correct now at least    I suggest to merge this now for next release even if hybrid guidance can't be fully checked before that.  fix #2331

I implemented the changes that were made there (that I believed to be correct) as well as the recommended preset resolutions (VGA  720p  1080p and full resolution).    One of the changes was in how the camera settings were used  I built upon these suggestions and updated the settings. Now the user only sets the output resolution  image zoom and centre offsets and the rest is computed to generate a good output.    As the isp can only be used with the bebop  I moved the isp files to the bebop board folder.    In the process of doing this I realised that the documentation for the bebop cameras was quite poor and decided to make a module for the bebop cameras so that the settings can be auto documented. This results in an additional module to include in the airframe. To make this a little easier I changed all video_thread includes in bebop airframes to bebop_cam (which autoloads video_thread  plz let me know if you disagree or have an alternative).    There are also some miscellaneous changes that I found while implementing the upgrades (e.g. a setting for camera with the bebop_ae_awb even though it explicitly only works with the front camera).    Apologies for another large PR but I think that this simplifies and clarifies the camera usage for the bebop.

It had a maximum of 1000 agents  while the fast 9 corner structure array was only 512 long. So  after long periods of little texture  the ACT corner file would write outside the memory  causing troubles with video capturing. Easy to find bug  which has now been removed.

As it is a separated module connected to the ABI bus  it can be used with any IMU and AHRS/INS combination by selecting the correct data source for the estimation filters.    The plot below shows the recording of the roll gyro  with the blue line the original noisy signal while the red line is the filtered value. The noise level is much lower but their is almost no lag during fast rotations.  ![gyro_time_one_euro](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/452802/55314020-861f2c80-5469-11e9-92c8-3357114434e2.jpg)    The FFT of the above signal shows the noise from the motors between 150 and 200 Hz that is almost completely removed.  ![gyro_fft_one_euro](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/452802/55314246-080f5580-546a-11e9-8d12-2957f1b219f0.jpg)    This filter is very cheap in terms of computation and also very easy to tune with only two parameters.  See http://cristal.univ-lille.fr/~casiez/1euro/ for more details.

The benefit is that you can fly without mag (which is pretty sensitive to calibration) but it is then not possible to estimate the drift with wind.  An other small change is the bounding of the accel scale factor estimation (coef `as`). Previously a very low value was stopping the filter to prevent a division by zero  even in flight. Now  the min/max values are just bounded to reasonable values.    It is also fixing a bug when checking the GPS ID for secondary receiver. The side effect of this bug was that gps heading was the true heading whatever the configuration.    This code have been tested in flight.

In short:  - Two example airframes:    - orangeavoid: uses waypoints for navigation    - orangeavoid_guided: uses body-frame guidance commands. Could potentially be used without OptiTrack (not tested). Uses a front-camera green detector to stay within the flight area.    - Camera defines have been updated after #2364. The color detector has been re-tuned afterwards.    - All aircraft are test-flown and tagged.  - New joystick confs:    - sm600.xml: for the new usb transmitters in the lab. Still a bit buggy sometimes  but flyable.    - turnigy  xbox  - The orange avoider is updated and separated into two modules: a colored object detector and an avoidance module. The modules communicate over ABI. The avoidance logic has been moved from the airframe to the avoidance module to make to code easier to understand and adapt. (All credit goes to @kirkscheper for this one).  - opencv_bebop is updated to 3.4.5 and now also includes the contrib modules. OpenCV is now also compiled for NPS  so that the same configuration is used in the sim as on the real drone.  - video_capture has been updated to capture image sequences in addition to still frames.  - file_logger has been partially rewritten for readability.  - A python script is added to measure the flown distance of an aircraft. This script can be run on any pc as long as it's connected to OptiTrack (thanks @dewagter and Shushuai Li).    The course documentation can be found here: https://tudelft.github.io/coursePaparazzi/

In addition to the creation of the aircraft and airframe  some additional  changes have been made:    1. Bebop camera calibration has been performed  2. Explicit rounding has been added to ins_int velocity estimate callback. This is necessary to prevent a bias towards a location of 0 when flying at low speeds.  3. An additional flight plan has been created. This flightplan is very similar to conf/flight_plans/rotorcraft_optitrack.xml   except for the removal of the "wait GPS" block  which prevents an airframe without GPS from compiling. This is significant code duplication  if there is a better way to fix this  please let me know.    The commit history is quite a mess  due to many tests  so squashing the commits would be very much appreciated.

It is the implementation of a tracking algorithm coming from this paper https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.00182 .    I have written some instructions in the wiki https://wiki.paparazziuav.org/wiki/Module/collective_tracking_control    For sure I am missing documentation. To be honest  I forgot exactly all the necessary doc items. So  if you do not mind  just tell me what is missing :P.    The "attached" Python simulation to tune the gains quickly is hardcoded for three aircraft + target. One day I should make it more general... but I believe it is easy to modify it by somebody if (s)he is interested in the algorithm.

The fix gives the correct result in the test  but is not flight tested.    Something else  but related:  I also realized that the use of Variable Length Arrays (VLA) leads to a lot more assembly code than fixed size arrays  and in this case it is not really needed if you call the algorithm with arguments of the same size. (Usage example: https://github.com/paparazzi/paparazzi/blob/master/sw/airborne/firmwares/rotorcraft/stabilization/wls/wls_alloc.c#L109)  I think that only if you would have two constrained least squares problems of different size to solve it could make sense to do it like this. Should we restrict it to 'single use' in order to make it faster?

This allows I2C to be used on arbitrary GPIO pins at a limited bitrate (approx. 15kbps). The software I2C code is completely non-blocking and platform-independent. Software-I2C (softi2c0  softi2c1) can transparently replace the existing I2C peripherals.    I2C writing has been tested with a logic analyzer. Reading has not been tested yet because I do not have the necessary tools at home.    Since this pull requests also makes minor changes to the existing I2C code (use of function pointers to allow mixing of multiple I2C architectures)  careful review and testing of existing airframes would be highly appreciated.    This PR is part of upcoming support for the Eachine Trashcan ([WIP](https://github.com/tomvand/paparazzi/tree/trashcan_spi_cc2500_pr)) and the bitcraze flowdeck.

This should speed up the computation time considerably.    I changed the variable length of the arrays to a length set by defines. The problem I ran into is that I am not sure exactly where to define these defines  as it should be possible to define them from the test  or from an airframe  directly or indirectly. If I include the airframe the test does not compile any more  while for the test I now put them in the makefile to make it work... I guess there must be a nice way of doing this right?

It turns out that the code from that PR does not even compile when you set to true the corresponding define. The code does not make much sense anyway  so it is better to delete it.    Once I have a chance  I will also check whether the dynamic sweep works correctly with the original poly survey.    The bright side is in the second commit. I have found a bug in the GVF for tracking lines defined with two points. It did not work correctly for the corner case of "perfect horizontal lines" (90 or 270 degrees). Testing the poly survey triggered the bug. Now the fix is even more elegant  and I tested it thoruhgfully in simulation.

For an example of how this was used  see my [research on the DelftaCopter](http://www.imavs.org/papers/2018/IMAV_2018_paper_17.pdf) (chirp graphs are at the end of the paper).    sys_id_chirp.xml and sys_id_chirp.h contain documentation but for a quick start  add the sys_id_chirp module to your airframe file and    ```<call fun="sys_id_chirp_add_values(autopilot_get_motors_on() FALSE values)">```    to the top of the ```command_laws``` section in your airframe file. Perform chirps by selecting the proper chirp settings in GCS and click "Chirp start" in the GCS strip!    A message is added for monitoring chirp during flight and automatically recognizing chirps in post-processing https://github.com/paparazzi/pprzlink/pull/96    The thing I'm not certain about: how to deal with the various axes that different aircraft have. During the chirp  the chirp signal is applied to a single actuator  but separate noise is also added to all other actuators (those specified by the user) to improve system identification. The user should be able to set the actuators to apply the chirps on in the airframe file. I opted for a define ```<define name="CHIRP_AXES" value="{COMMAND_ROLL COMMAND_PITCH COMMAND_YAW}"/>``` that has a default value in the header and can be overridden in the airframe file. This is a very flexible way since users with exotic airframes (and exotic actuator names) can specify freely the axes to work with. There is a downside: in the GCS you pick the axis to apply the chirp to. Ideally  this would be a dropdown menu with the specific axes named. Right now it's just a slider with every value corresponding to an index in the CHIRP_AXES (and values outside that range being ignored by a handler). Suggestions for how this could be improved are welcome.

Why ?    Because the current one looks like this: http://wiki.paparazziuav.org/wiki/DevGuide/AircraftBuildProcess. Basically a program is called from `make`  calling more independent generator using `make` from syscalls  getting the result from stdout  or temp files  or both. And the XML configuration files are parsed several times by different tools in this process.    The idea here  is that everything related to code generation is handled by a single program. All necessary config files are passed as input  parsed all together (with module dependency resolution someday...)  then code is generated if needed. The parsing library can also be reuse by other tools such as the server or the paparazzicenter.    So what's next ?  I don't expect this code to be actually reviewed because:  - it is in ocaml  - it is in ocaml  - it is way too big    So if you want to go with this  the only way is to actually use it  and fix it if needed. It is passing the standard tests  but there are maybe some corner cases.  It should be functionally the same and should work in most cases. However  here are some changes:  - no more `submodule` allowed in airframe files  - `modules` node is still supported  but I would like to get ride of it  - some minor changes (old way still supported): `module` -> `header` in settings XML file  `ctl` not mandatory in radio files  `reverse` allowed in radio instead of swapping min/max values  ...    A nice knew addition (to be tested a bit more): you can define a PAPARAZZI_MODULES_PATH environment variable to set a list of external places where to find paparazzi modules (XML and source code).    All comments are welcome.

Ported from betaflight. I copied the code with the least amount of editing possible to simplify later updates. RC channels work as normal  and both up- and downlink are supported in the form of a generic paparazzi serial device. I have included a module and an opentx lua script to tunnel pprzlink (up+down) over frsky to a pc. FrskyX telemetry is also available in limited form.      I have left the betaflight headers/license (GPLv3) in place to give proper credit  and added the paparazzi license where substantial code was added. Let me know if this is the right way to handle this.    - **DFU command module**. Reset the STM32F4 to DFU using a command over the USB serial line. The command is compatible with betaflight  so drones with the betaflight firmware can be flashed directly out-of-the-box. (Note that the linux serial driver may need a while to connect  and that the trashcan sometimes needs batteries plugged in due to the FPV camera current draw). The command is automatically sent when pressing upload if the module is added to the airframe.      The STM DFU bootloader is very particular about the processor state at boot  and support from OpenCM is pretty limited  so the code may look slightly hackish. Feedback welcome.    - **Trashcan board files and airframe**. Original files provided by @OpenUAS  thanks! Airframe tuning needs to follow in a later PR but the drone is flyable right now.    This PR has been lying on the shelf for a bit too long because corona made it difficult to test-fly  so I'd rather get it merged now than wait while it gets further out of sync with master. The only things I have not finished yet is the airframe  this can be tuned in a later PR. The drone flies ok right now  and I have already used this code during the development of the flowdeck drivers.

I had some problems where the sensor would not boot reliably (either no I2C ACKnowledge  or SCL pulled low indefinitely after the first writes succeeded). I'm not 100% sure this is the fix  but it seems to work better now.... The 2V8 setting is also used in the crazyflie firmware as far as I can tell.    edit: my sensor still does not boot reliably. This might still be a useful change  though.

The module part can record all commands and imu data by default  plus a number of other sensor if required (position  speed  airspeed ...).  The ground tool is able to read the data and apply a series of filters before calling the optimization to find fitting parameters. A mixing matrix can also be applied to find cross talk like for full indi). Not all sensor models are implemented yet. The process is configured with a json file.  This is not really tested  only in the case of simple indi. And I'm not completely sure of the mixing part  so @EwoudSmeur   I would appreciate your opinion on this !  Hopefully some day we won't edit the code by hand for every aircraft to tune for indi ;)

A quaternion is made from the current attitude in euler angles  but for this a 'pitch-corrected' heading is used (a heading that points in the same direction if you pass 90 deg pitch. This is a problem  because if interpreted as a normal ZYX euler angle set the reference attitude is incorrectly set. The result is a 180 yaw movement when switching between FWD and ATT with pitch < -90 deg. The real unedited ZYX euler angles should be used instead.    Actually  looking at it again  should the ref psi be reset at all? Ref phi and theta are also not reset...

Unfortunately the current paparazzi code makes calls directly to the libopencm3 gpio functions without any HAL inbetween  so I had to use some gcc magic to wrap those functions. This is a bit hacky and will probably not port to other compilers.    I have tested the gpio_setup_output and gpio_toggle functions and these seem to work well. (Tested on Trashcan STM32F4 with softI2C to PCA9536).    I have renamed the pca95x4 peripheral to pca95xx  as it is also compatible with the pca953**6** that I am using.

We have extended the notion of the GVF to support a bigger set of trajectories (including 3D ones).    I am almost finished with the [Wiki entry](https://wiki.paparazziuav.org/wiki/Module/guidance_vector_field)  now I have split it into two parts: GVF implicit (the already implemented) and this new one GVF parametric. As it says in the wiki  both modules are compatible and can coexist.    It has been already tested with real flights. In fact  @mrtbrnz has tried the 3D ellipse too with one of the zaggies he told me.    Please  take your time  and whatever you do not see clear  or you want different just tell me. @gautierhattenberger you mentioned that you would like to have the "low level" control isolated? This is happening here  https://github.com/noether/paparazzi/blob/gvf_advanced/sw/airborne/modules/guidance/gvf_parametric/gvf_parametric.cpp#L317 and here https://github.com/noether/paparazzi/blob/gvf_advanced/sw/airborne/modules/guidance/gvf_parametric/gvf_parametric.cpp#L207 . Let me know whether this is okeish. In the near future  these GVFs should work with rovers and boats.    The GVF app (python) is valid for both versions implicit and parametric. However  is far from being okeish since I was patching here and there for the new GVF. It consumes a lot of resources since I have to think how to plot more efficiently (right now I think I create a new figure every iteration  and this is far from good). Suggestions are also welcome here. Nevertheless  the GVF app works ok  it is just "slow" and far from being efficient.    @EwoudSmeur   for the cyclone/hybrid  let me know which guidance signals would you like to have for a 3D trajectory. After the holidays  I would like to have the two GVFs working with a rotorcraft  so I will provide the desired 3D accelerations  but maybe for the hybrid your would like to have something different.

To use it  it is just needed to provide macros or functions with the form `MyNavXxxxx` for all nav instructions like `NavCircleWaypoint` or `NavGotoWaypoint`. Then call the FP instructions like this:    ` <circle wp="WP1" radius="80" nav_type="MyNav"/>`    In this example  `MyNavCircleWaypoint` will be called instead of the default `NavCircleWaypoint`.

I propose to fix it to what I think is the most logical.    When the replay starts  the server send the message `ground NEW_AIRCRAFT replay1`.  When requested by the `AIRCRAFTS_REQ` message  the server also reply with `replay1`.  In all later messages  the server use `replay1` as ac_id as well.  The only exception is that  when requested with the `CONFIG_REQ` message  the server replay with `1` as ac_id.  I think it should reply with `replay1`.    The only code I found to be affected by this change is in pprz_connect  which assume the id is an integer. Removing the cast to integer fix it  and makes a previously erroneous docstring true.    This could break external code  however  considering that `ac_id` fields in the `ground` message class are all of type string  I think that such code should be fixed anyway.

Hardcoded as before  so pprzlink v1 is no longer supported...  - Reduce download chunk size to 64 bytes max. I had missing packets (not sure if buffers on the drone or on my pc are overflowing)  fixed by limiting the max number of bytes sent at once.  - ~~Remove warning from settings_xml_parse.py because it was interfering with the download program. Not sure if this is used anywhere else...~~  - Updated documentation.    The fixes are slightly hacky in places because I did not have a lot of time to work on this. Let me know if something needs to be fixed/cleaned-up.    Tested on stm32f4 (trashcan/crazybeef4fr) with the bitcraze usd-deck with a transcend 8GB class 10 MicroSDHC and with usb_serial as sdlogger downlink device. Compilation tested with Lisa Hex airframe with uart as downlink device.

The problem is that the correct value is only available after generating the makefile and calling "make" again (old process)  but it is not possible anymore have the information from the start  and only the default freq was used (as reported in #2537).  So  instead of a static prescaling computed by the generators  the prescaler values are now computed at compile / run time.  In terms of frequency  it should be similar to the old code as long as there is no periodic functions trying to go faster than the base frequency. It was previously reported by the generator  it won't be the case anymore. A future improvement would be to have checks at compile time eventually.  The only change I'm expecting so far  is the balancing of the functions (to avoid to have all periodic functions called in the same loop). The old way required the base frequency  so it is replaced by something slightly different that should have the same effect. However  there is no guarantee that the sequence of modules' functions will be exactly the same.    I have only tested this code in simulation at the moment  so hardware tests would be welcome.

I tested it on a Bebop 1  I added the required defines to the `bebop_opticflow_indoor.xml` airframe to showcase the module usage  but perhaps making a whole new airframe might be better.    I have not found a clever solution on how to avoid writing a lot of duplicate code for the defines in `cv_opticflow.xml` (and as a consequence in the initialization of the multiple `opticflow_t` structs). Originally I intended for the module to be able to run on an arbitrary number of cameras  but due to how Paparazzi handles module defines I had to hardcode it to front and bottom cameras only in a lot of places.    There are a lot of changes that have been made already  the next step would be to change the opticflow ABI message  since (from my understanding) it's not currently possible to distinguish if the message contains results from the front or the bottom camera.

I have olse dropped a few boards:  - discovery: there is a support of the nucleo144 with F7 for people testing on breakout boards  - VMS ECU: not sure this project is still running or using this code  @podhrmic if yes  I can add it back  no problem  - XVert: I'm not even sure it ever worked and the frame is not produced or sold

The no go zone is defined with two way points (like the rectangle). The survey will map the whole area  while not considering this area in its survey. I have also attached an example flight plan to run with.    This is not fully complete  but is probably an experimental feature. The things that are left to do...       1. Assure that the no-go zone is not violated by the u-turns between runs (possibly by shrinking the valid survey size)       2. Assure that the no-go zone is not violated by the travel between partial surveys (possibly done by defining the navigation  path between surveys.

The  number of tested airframes (full compilation of all targets) have been  reduced to speed the CI compile time but still covers the relevant  architecture and boards.  The main benefit is that the overall coverage is already better than  before as previous test aircraft were compiling more or less the same  part of the airborne code  while this new mechanism is more efficient to  test modules not included in any config.

I think it is not really helpful to have this saturation limit here (one would need to make a new nps_sensors h file for every sensor setup) while most of the time we're not interested in simulating this limit anyway. Would it make sense to just set it to a large value in the default?

It turns out that sensor params where completely wrong for saturation and freq  which was make simulation run wild in many situations. With this  the default file should adapt to most cases  with nearly perfect sensors. A noisy file example is kept for testing.

The new structure is made to guarantee a certain sequence in the init phase and between the tasks' blocks. In particular  a fixed time between some tasks can fixed: between sensor periodic and estimation periodic  between estimation and control  etc.    As a result  all modules have been updated to fit into their dedicated tasks. In addition to that  the dependencies between module in terms of actual modules or functionalities have been explicitly specified. The module generator is therefore checking that all required components are loaded. New modules automatically loaded according the current target/firmware/board have been introduced and may replace the makefiles at some point.    Some minor changes are included here like a few airframe update  unused code cleaning  fixes for warnings ...    Some work is still needed  especially concerning the actuators and radio control (due to FBW splitting) or baro (stupid "baro_board" subsystem). This can be done in a later PR  this one is already big enough...    It would be nice to do more test on real hardware. My own test are working for CI compilation  simulation  and a few real frames.

The branch has been extensively tested and validated successfully. During the development also other modules have been improved. In total  this PR brings improvements on:    - ins_ekf2 module: new optical flow interface  - mateksys_3901_l0x: added rotation compensation for height + calibration strategy  - gps_datalink: used to get fake gps  now gives also fake magnetometer if selected by the user  - Nederquad: new airframe for quadrotor used at TUDelft    Added wiki on flow sensor: https://wiki.paparazziuav.org/wiki/Module/Mateksys_3901_l0x  Added wiki on ins_ekf2: https://wiki.paparazziuav.org/wiki/Subsystem/ins#ekf2 (to be finished)

This completely messes up the IMU attitude state. those boards are unique  to expensive or not feasible to replace chip.To still be able to fly these flight-controllers an 3value median filter is added to the RAW output. Default MPU module behaviour is still the same but by adding` <define name="IMU_MPU_USE_MEDIAN_FILTER" value="TRUE"/>` to the mpu6000 module in airframe the issue is resolved with this fix  see screenshot of before and after... BTW mind the Scale  no it is not more noise... ;-)    An airframe was added to PR be able to validate and testfly the fix.    ### **Before**  ![BeforeFix](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/483944/128871438-3dfb38df-6464-4b26-b176-efc45b703c6f.png)    ### **After**  ![AfterFix](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/483944/128871480-9edd49bd-9f8c-471b-8505-7d872ffd96b2.png)

The attitude error is decomposed in a tilt and a twist part  and the  tilt error is compensated assuming that the rotation around z is zero  (very slow in comparison).    I can add the test to the other algebra tests if needed.
